Here's a breakdown of the insights and underlying sentiments conveyed in the transcript:\\n\\n1. **Bitcoin's Current Position**: Tino highlights the significance of Bitcoin's position around $70,000, indicating that maintaining above $70,500 is crucial for further upward potential. This suggests a bullish outlook, contingent on Bitcoin sustaining key levels.\\n\\n2. **Market Context and Google Earnings**: The importance of Google's earnings is emphasized, as they can significantly impact market sentiment, especially in the technology sector. Positive Google earnings may lead to favorable conditions for Bitcoin and other risk assets. However, he advises caution during the New York open when these earnings are released due to potential volatility.\\n\\n3. **AI Market Influence**: The discussion about the AI sector, driven by companies like Nvidia and Google, implies that strong tech earnings can provide a supportive environment for Bitcoin's price action. This interlinked market sentiment highlights a bullish undertone contingent on tech performance.\\n\\n4. **Potential Risks and Corrections**: Tino urges traders to be cautious of a potential sharp correction if Bitcoin were to drop below key moving averages (such as the 13 EMA on the daily), highlighting the risk of a 4.5% drop from current levels. This serves as a reminder to manage risk, even in a bullish scenario.\\n\\n5. **Market Illusions and Fed Policies**: He warns against complacency in the market and stresses the potential for a pullback if Federal Reserve policies or broader economic indicators shift. This caution indicates awareness of macroeconomic factors that could influence Bitcoin's price trajectory.\\n\\n6. **Institutional Interest and Accumulation**: Notably, Tino mentions significant Bitcoin inflows and accumulation by major players like BlackRock, suggesting strong institutional interest, which is a positive signal for Bitcoin's long-term prospects.\\n\\n7. **Trading Strategy and Psychological Factors**: Tino emphasizes managing expectations and taking profits, especially as Bitcoin approaches all-time highs. He discusses potential psychological barriers for traders and investors at these levels, suggesting a prudent approach of taking profits to mitigate risks of sharp pullbacks.\\n\\n8. **Volatility and Upcoming Events**: Upcoming events, such as the U.S. elections, monthly candle closures, and further earnings reports, are highlighted as factors that could introduce volatility, reinforcing the need for vigilance.\\n\\nIn essence, Tino conveys a cautiously bullish stance for Bitcoin, with optimism tied to supportive tech earnings and institutional accumulation.

flirting with that 70k I see your comments you're all like does Bitcoin need to do this it needs to go here to do that to go where no it's irrelevant what's the story well what we're going into this week is a very in my opinion a very pressing week for the marketplace only because we've got fomc speakers coming out giving us their idea of what they think the interest rate should be and whether we're going to get the big cuts or not we've got earnings announcements from the big boys Tesla Amazon they're going to be letting us know how business is and there's a lot of pressure on these companies to sustain the earnings announcement so we're going to hope that things are well no hope in trading but we're going to anticipate that things are still good for the economy you got manufacturing data coming out this week again you got Bank of Canada talking about cutting their interest rates you got the Euro itself working out whether or not they should ease a little bit more boy oh boy and we're not even around the corner to fomc we got the election and that's getting even more interesting as well so what do we know well a lot of people are looking at Bitcoin thinking hold on a second like all this money that's going into Bitcoin to be exact $20 billion has hit into the Bitcoin ETF and we're going to try and understand why Bitcoin hasn't made the move just yet is it because it's going to go into the election and we want to make sure that we know Trump's going to win or is Harris going to win you've got to really ask yourself the question is Bitcoin giving us the idea that as a leading indicator could Bitcoin be a leading indicator to suggest that once the election comes into play Bitcoin will then explode but what if Bitcoin moves up because of a much bigger problem the US debt that's what we're going to be looking at today we going to dive into this story about the US debt and I saw what's even funny I saw this image on X that was shared last night and there was all this pava about oh my God look at how much the banks owe I mean we've been talking about this for a little while right now and that is the unrealized losses and gains but mainly losses for banks in the United States so we're going to go back to that is just to reignite that flavor and give you a bit of an awareness of what may come is it going to be a financial collapse would that be the Black Swan event because you got to go back and look at the subprime mortgage crisis they declared the subprime mortgage crisis and then eight weeks later the market dropped so they knew that there was a crisis and they still kept on buying they didn't care because people in the street and Retail investors make one mistake and that mistake is they think that the economy is the stock market and sometimes they think the stock market is the economy if it's good on the stock market it's good for the economy well we've kind of got that right now but I don't believe it I don't trust it it's just an election play itself because Trump even said it he said that once the election comes into play and we know who's going to win if he were to win and go into office then he knows there's going to be a few problems that he's going to have to address you got tariffs that he wants to put on companies around the world mainly China and then you've got the tariffs that are going to hit the Euro Zone by the US how is that stimulating an economy it's just it's squeezing it anyways let's get into the program ladies and gentlemen mad love and respect to everyone passing through yes we've got ourselves don't forget the war my guy who did say it yep don't forget that bad boy a failed assassination attempt is going to make matters even worse so let's get with the program break it all down and hopefully by the end of this live stream you know exactly what to anticipate going into this week so welcome welcome welcome let's start the live with a few likes ladies and gentlemen 175 of you amazing people have done ever so well to just click the most minimal effort thing now I know some of you watching it on a TV just go and hit your TV if it doesn't work never mind you need to get a new TV man you got to get that touchcreen stuff your phones are a touchcreen why isn't your TV my TV isn't a touch screen but anyways so we're on the same page let's get with the program gang here we go yeah look at this so Finance ministers around the world are going to be meeting up and trying to talk about this1 trillion doll fiscal time bomb that keeps ticking yeah so the world owes this much right1 trillion doll don't forget yeah the US makes up around a third of that 37 or 35 nearly trillion dollar olded and I saw this right here and look at this US Treasury total debt total public debt outstanding we saw this big spike up here only just recently what are they doing what are they doing this right here is dismissive it's doesn't matter let's just print even more it's absolutely wild how this is going to be sustained I want to know when they start talking about the debt ceiling again when are they going to have the conversation about that because the US will never default they won't allow it to default even when Moody's credit rating and and and and Fitch when they were giving out the credit rating on the US credit rating itself they dropped it down so I think it was a double A and it was a AAA and then they dropped it down to a double A and then they didn't like it they said it's going to be bad for business so they ended up putting it back up to the standard one at being at the top like come on man if you can if you go look at the last time the US credit rating was dropped right they put it straight back up they said well we're not having any of that what is that what's the point in the credit rating itself it's only good for companies no it's not they actually moved it back up because it's not a good thing for foreign investors unbelievable so this is where we are with the public debt now let me just show you a couple of things that are going to help you understand how this could effectively lead to maybe look the the listen the Black Swan event is an event that just happens out of nowhere did we see the idea of the subprime morgage crisis coming into play well the film The Big Short shows you how that developed into the subprime mortgage crisis when he was going around asking all the the the strippers how are you getting all these properties and they were like I was just doing you know just going to the bank and they were offering me this and that and I just put down my house or didn't even get the house or collateral I just got the money and they just gave it to me so this is something that leads up an event towards what would be deemed a Black Swan okay and the Black Swan itself is just oh my God it's just taking Everyone by storm but it doesn't because it's something that develops right you've got the US debt climbing up still a bit more all right now let's just go and have a look at a couple of metrics overall okay I've shown you this chart and I showed it to you last week this is the stock market correction probability by this chart here if it isn't at 50 50% because when you go into it all it says here if the probability the the objective of the gray shaded areas in the chart represent the periods when the msci AWI emerging market index underwent Corrections of 15% or more and the objective of this model is to estimate the probability of such gray zones basically when it hits 50% that's when we really need to start getting a bit concerned about the chances of a stock market correction well it doesn't look like we're anywhere near it now all right 15% away but looks like things are good when we go over to the sentiment of smart money dumb money we can see that smart money has yet to hit an extreme historically based on this chart it tells you that how often is smart money selling and how often is smart money buying but they do it the opposite that means when prices are going up smart money is selling when prices are going down smart money is buying okay retail right now is pumped retail is loving life okay and we're in extreme look at the extreme right here and usually we can spend time around those extremes but this could be something that is pending now take all of the information that we've got an election pending interest rate Cuts change in monetary policy okay you've got Bank of Japan they are now trying to work out should we be cutting the interest rates or not so whilst they're trying to work that out carry trade Traders are coming in taking advantage of a cheaper Yen getting that putting it into dollars and then putting those dollars to work by going into the stock market going over over into the NASDAQ and the S&P you can see the NASDAQ took a nice little flavors some drop to the downside I'm currently playing some positions right now and I've got to be very careful so I started off my um 5K challenge again so let me just show you so this is where we started off originally so this is the Live account so I started off this is a 50k to 5K account so the last one that I did is still got the history there you got the 5K where we started off over here well it's not actually that wait a second well basically you go back in the live and you'll see it rather than me messing around with it but we took it all the way up to a balance of around 63,000 and then we just waited and then I withdrew everything started again with the 5K and now we're in around a $6,900 profit per se but not profit but we're in yeah here we go a $1600 profit on a long on the NASDAQ okay that's what I've got right now it seems like NASDAQ is doing very well it's going up I've got four contracts and it just seems to be on a bit of a pump right now so that's Happy Days right there and also playing options on the NASDAQ as well on another account so I've got options on the S&P and the NASDAQ which are favoring higher prices and we've got around 2,180 profit on that and I'm holding that until the end of the day because I'm expecting the NASDAQ to try and make a bit of a significant recovery back up because Monday is always going to be a tricky day but I do need to be very careful with this because NASDAQ can be a bit of a pain in the ass so I'm going to be monitoring this whilst we're live today and I'm be paying attention to how NASDAQ behaves but what we've got to be mindful of going into this week guys is the idea that the week itself is filled with red folder days okay now what I'm talking about in regards to the US debt and the probability of the world or the stock market correcting okay is going to lead up or improve the odds of it happening if this week we actually don't get a good reading on all of the earnings that are due to come out cuz right now we're not really talking about the interest rates because investors are sort of pricing that in okay but what we're going into this week is very important Monday we don't really have any big news announcements but going into Tuesday we have GE Aerospace Now defense-based Stocks always tend to do well during times of uncertainty but is it really a time of uncertainty well we know gold is shooting up if you just go over to gold right now you can see gold is just clearing out significant ranges ladies and gentlemen this thing is going absolutely crazy going into 1 hour time frame at all time significant highs and we are so guys we are only really just under $300 away from gold hitting $3,000 look at Silvera silvera's on route to hitting that $50 an ounce man it's getting very very interesting and they're talking about 2025 being a prize point for go for Silvera at $75 around 2025 so it's this will only escalate if investors are starting to get a little bit concerned about what's going on overseas now you may have heard about this this drone attempt attack on Benjamin and I said it right it's it's worse that it was an assassination attempt and failed at that cuz now they're just going to go in even harder on them so it's like we can now assume that there could be a possibility that we're going to see another retaliation on top of this now I did hear about some guy on X saying that there is a possibility that they are purposely waiting before the election well they're going to wait for the election to come into play before they do relas another attack the the speculation behind it is it's not going to look good on the party who knows I don't know but it's I don't want to dive into that because then we're going to start getting all the conspiracy dudes coming out with that logic and be like yo maybe maybe not I don't want to do it but what I've got to understand is we know something is pending right which tells me that there is still going to be the safe haven being engaged now taking that information so we've got a problem with the US de and look I'll be frank with you all guys with the US debt going up and what have you in regards to this image over here it doesn't matter let's be honest all right they'll do a correction it will crash and then it will just come back up again because everyone still does things in dollars all right coffee dollars oil dollars gas dollars what else soybean wheat corn you name it when oxygen is being offered then we can still get that in dollars it's just unbelievable but with the US debt and all that that coming into play with the idea of tensions overseas that's one thing right then we got our good old unrealized gains and the banks have been declaring such great results in their earnings only off their trading activities let's not get it twisted but it's enough to get the market stimulated to Keep On Believing that the markets are on sale mode the even analysts are talking about readjusting their price Targets on stocks ladies and gentlemen if that doesn't stink like a climatic move to the upside then I don't know what is because if you've got now analysts coming out and rating companies turning around saying that we need to actually increase our price estimates for stocks in the future come on man if everything's alltime highs that doesn't make sense it doesn't why is Warren selling up Warren buffit why is he selling up everything it doesn't sit right with me and these unrealized games and losses in the chart right here it's 5126 billion right and the last time that happened was in 2018 with $252 billion of losses and we are in exactly the same time frame going into the next quarter around September October time is when it got declared 2018 crash happened well does it look like the Market's going to crash ladies and and Gentlemen let's just go and have a look at the the the NASDAQ what's NASDAQ doing well NASDAQ looks like it's doing very very nicely I've got a little alert there I need to get rid of that okay so it looks like it's holding out nasdaq's not too far away from its alltime high ladies and gentlemen I mean come on why isn't NASDAQ hitting the alltime high don't worry about that because Nvidia is going to be saving NASDAQ and that's one thing for sure going over to Nvidia pre-markets you can see it's where is it where are you pre-market give me some flavor on the pre-market oh gaping up no where is it in the premarket oh so no one's been really busy on Nvidia at the at the in the out of hours markets okay then so it seems like it's a little bit quiet across the board for NVIDIA but nvidia's at alltime highest ladies and gentlemen look at this red Vector candle they're coming back for that 140 they will surpass that they really will because they're all looking forward to nvidia's earnings announcements and everyone's now rushing in trying to pick up Nvidia on the cheap okay Nvidia is leading the market I'm telling you it really is and AI stock is leading it all so what about our dearly beloved Bitcoin ladies and gentlemen what is bitcoin doing well Bitcoin doesn't look like it's enjoying itself right now but that's standard you'd expect a little bit of a recovery back down but what news is coming into cryptocurrency check this out Bitcoin stores below 70k despite 20 billion ETF Milestone so all this money that's going into Bitcoin right now yet Bitcoin doing nothing about it let me explain something to you in front of you by the logic of the hybrid system whenever you start seeing red Vector candles appearing as a move to the upside is starting to occur you've got to say to yourself hold on a second if the red vectors because you can see Bitcoin is very extended to the upside absolutely extended to the upside and when you look at the journey that bitcoin's been making as it's been moving up you highlight the red Vector candles you can see that they're most of the time going back into recovering them and this in principle is their attempt to load up Longs at the highest possible point or in the highest point at the lowest range so right now you can see Bitcoin looks like it's dropping retail's now wet in the bed what's going on is they're actually bidding Bitcoin zooming out we can see where we are in terms of liquidations you can see that we started to we just hit all these liquidation points over here and we got a few high margin points right there as well but we've got a few bids coming in got 6 million right there I know at the 70k there's around $15 million worth of bitcoin wanting to be sold it's not that much but that will trigger an interest in traders to sell Bitcoin okay and this move back down is correct it's healthy for Bitcoin all right people that are going to lose their brains right now saying that's it now bitcoin's going to go down if Bitcoin goes down fine it goes down but what you've got to take into consideration is this it's not stopped going up okay but a lot of people are relying on the idea that Bitcoin might actually still continue higher look at how close we are to 70k and we couldn't even take it some might see that as weakness some see might see that as strength but this could be one last attempt cuz if you look at the daily time frame you've got price still holding around the 5 and 13 EMA if today's daily candle does not close above the 5 EMA which is this yellow line all you holders might still be able to get Bitcoin on a little bit of a discount but you would have to factor in the idea that Bitcoin could come back down towards the 13 EMA which sits around the 6628 well that all depends on how it performs today now because the New York Stock Market is yet to be open in another 10 more minutes the the logic is that they're moving lower then that means they're going to start triggering people's interest to start buying Bitcoin because it's pulling back so it could be a buying opportunity in the sense that for the day range they've actually hit prices lower and we're trading at the day's low of the range itself in principle look it's just there there's no Wick so no one's really stepping in just yet to pick up Bitcoin okay and when we when we start seeing the Wicks appearing that's when interest could actually start to be generated where enough people are in running in shorts right now thinking okay cool now I'm going to start going short because bitcoin's going down when you start seeing the wick developing that's where you got to really start paying attention so for those guys who are on the daily time frame look at how the daily time frame behaves from this current point because even though now it's starting to form a little bit of a wick but we need to really see a bit of a return backup to start building the idea of a wick being created putting it into perspective if we just go over to here this is EXO charts and if I just show you bitcoin's daily profile where we are right now on bitcoin right here is we're trading at the value area low and you can see here value area low is where they're building a profile of interest for investors and buyers and sellers who are like okay I like Bitcoin at this price I'm going to start buying or I don't like Bitcoin at this price I'm going to start selling because I think it's going to go even lower looking at the depth of Market I can see that we don't really have that much commitment or in other words contracts above 80 80 is what I'm paying attention to just seeing 240 coming at 20 at 68750 which happens to be above the point of control and above the vwap itself most of the contracts to be traded on bitcoin are at this price level over here which is at 68,69 2 234 62 149 the book needs to be level okay now look at the volume profile if I just draw the volume profile of what you're seeing right here on the chart you'll then start to understand something so look at this if I draw this out just go on a smaller time frame on bitcoin to help you understand that logic okay if I just do this okay and then bring that back up what you've got here is this this is where the bulk of the liquidity is and that's this area right here okay go down you've got this area here which is this one right here okay down here we're starting to build a relationship we're starting to learn we're starting to get to know each other yeah I like this area yeah maybe we should go to the next level I know your name now let's go to the next level which would be the area of value but the analogy of the stock market in the sense where we're using the Dance Floor the dance floor is right here and this over here is where the cheap champagne is well you don't want to be drinking cheap champagne all night do you you want to get back to the dance hall and start you you know getting your game on start moving about and then you want to go to the most expensive part of the nightclub which is where the champagne is at the flavor some price of 69450 that's where you're like where you would ideally want to be getting your Bitcoin in principle you want to be buying your Bitcoin in these areas here until it can sustain the idea that it's happy with paying the prices at that point until it's not where they know that they can get more interest in price all the way up here and then if they really do get the interest then they'll find people up here happy to buy it so what you've got what you've got to do when you're trading Bitcoin is you've got to run that dialogue with yourself because at the end of the day for every time price changes it's because someone believes something and there someone that doesn't believe something and you want to see more of someone believing something in the sense if we want to see Bitcoin trying to move back up again then you need to start seeing more commitment of people coming in at this point because look the profile's increasing it's 1,300 now you got 1 12200 here 1250 go all the way back to the top right now you don't really see those big figures okay you do see hundreds and a thousand and such but it's all starting to develop here and as long as they can sustain this point here then this logically could say that this could be the low it may be the low for the day who knows we don't know because some dude could come in and be like you know what forget this I'm offloading because we do have quite a few bids down below there's 271 bids down here at 67290 234 bids at 67210 so that tells me that there is someone down there that's prepared to quite a bit of capital for Bitcoin so what really we need to be looking out for is people holding price at this point to effectively make those guys down here believe that they're not going to be seeing that price point which is going to naturally force them to put their orders in a little bit higher and then you see Bitcoin come down a little bit trigger the interest in this range here and then yippy K to the upside in that sense we've also had great news about xrp what's Elon talking about xrp for I like Elon he's mentioned it I'm not happy with him he just basically said someone asked him this question here we go El was asked do you envision The xrp Ledger being incorporated into the financial institutions of the future he said this is definitely not an endorsement good lad or a lack of endorsement you stupid person but he does think here we go I do think where was it bring it up come on I do think crypto by its very nature helps with individual Freedom urah thank you very much xrp I mean Elon for that crazy ass comment but anyways Peter's at it again Peter's talking about Bitcoin to 150k this guy hasn't really had the greatest optimistic move on bitcoin but he's now talking about 150k Bitcoin so by that logic he's talking about the expanding seven-month inverted triangle so really Posh to Lon and he is just saying that that this chart right here is going to suggest that Bitcoin is going to go he says here look long Bitcoin is my single largest speculative position so the the get around to being wrong on that logic is speculative position and it's all speculation ladies and gentlemen mad love to Peter Brandy but 150k Bitcoin logic would say that it should have been there a long time ago but backing the idea of this 20 billion dollar worth of the ETF Milestone that's coming to play in 10 months that is massive Bitcoin has yet to make the move to the upside so we're just sat there thinking what's it waiting for are we waiting for the the election like what's your opinion on it all ladies and gentlemen think bitcoin's waiting for the election I mean come on let's be honest some of you don't like me even saying this but let's be honest now Kamala Kamala I don't even know how to say her name Harris like when you put Usher up there I'm like get that now whether you like the guy or not he's getting the support and I think there's only seven states left that really need to decide what they've got to do all right but I don't know man I don't know no one's bloody perfect but it just looks like it's trumps some of you might not like me saying that you know what the end of the day we got to be paying close attention to how this bad boy works because as much as Trump likes crypto he always about the dollar always okay quickly going into the NASDAQ see how she's doing she's come and hit that line right now not really doing that much quickly going over into the yields um the yields are around the 4% Mark that's not very good don't want the yields to be going up I need to see what the bonds are doing bonds are trading lower but risk is coming into the marketplace NASDAQ seems to be holding out the S&P seems to be going up very well nicely oil's making a bit of a move ah it's starting to roll okay then um just quickly going over into the Euro Euro starting to roll over guys going over into gold see how the Market's reacting to Gold it's just a couple more minutes before the market does actually open gold is in that Trend worthy so don't be frightened by any drops down any red Vector candles coming into play they're going to sustain gold to the upside anyway that's what my belief is but I'd be very very cautious when you are trying to short go don't even dare short gold even if you do see a nice bold move lower don't if you're Shor in Gold you really want I mean look you don't want a short gold okay and the people that are fighting to short gold this is what happens when they're shorting gold because people are like oh my God it can't keep on going higher yes it can of course it can it can always keep going up so just be very very careful when you are effectively shorting gold all right take quick profits and get out any questions gang any questions don't be worried about the thumbnail it's it's not me it's it's all good yeah I am I do sound better I am actually all good my neck's all right right now we are actually all good but listen guys just a quick one for you are you guys like does anybody want the two ethereum or not we're got got two ethereum to give away like get involved with this okay where you do it you just go over and join btcc just take a screenshot of this stuff right here so you can see the exact criteria of how to participate in this act ual giveaway so you get platinum members get 0.5 eth all right so we select a platinum member which has got a discount right now of 20% okay and that's for the whole month get a discount off for the whole month and then for anyone else in the Traders reality Community we're going to split 1.5 e so .5 e to three people and the way you get involved in that is you become btcc trade on btcc where you can trade Nvidia you can trade Netflix you can trade all the rest of the gang and the NASDAQ NASDAQ is Tech 100 okay and it's great for anyone in the United States because you don't need kyc to participate working on that platform 225x leverage don't use it all I'm serious we have a little bit of a laugh and a joke about leverage but don't use 225x you're just asking to get slapped in the face you really are just don't be manageable work with leverage okay gives you the luxury of using someone else's cash so you don't have to commit much okay don't commit too much and more leverage you're just going to get burnt your last five minutes don't do it okay be be be mindful with your leverage ladies and gentlemen okay cool everything you need is in the description of the live stream go and check those guys out now what the hell has NASDAQ just done look at that oh my days NASDAQ has just jumped jped up my position has gone absolutely crazy 5K position holy shoot why has NASDAQ just shot up oh my days what are you doing Nasdaq all right okay then so 5K profit so far so good on NASDAQ that was a little bit too much there I didn't expect them to do it so well our options 4K awesome and it's going to keep going daily open could be on the test so my options are looking very nice got 5K up there we've doubled our account already on the 5K challenge bloody L NASDAQ I didn't expect you to do that so quick have to keep an eye on that bad boy and what's Bitcoin doing all done all done all done all done oh let's just quickly go back over there might come back down I just got to be careful with it but the market has just opened give me a second Bitcoin what you do um let me just quickly go back to NASDAQ just to keep an ey out on that yeah I thought you'd do that nice little stop run but I'm just going to give it a little bit of Freedom think I'm going to get rid of it guys hold on just keeping an eye out on NASDAQ how it's behaving nice little stop run there where is depth of Market on NASDAQ let me just go to the tick chart and have a look oh point of control rejection so you really need to start showing your worth and coming in here hold on come on there's the boys H little stop run up staying in the area of value back at the point of control right there okay so oh stopping volume candle Brink SPX they're going to come and try and recover that daily open has to be taken ladies and gentlemen nonetheless it has to do it but I got to be careful money is money at the end of the day so there's wanting more but then there's you've just experiened the fast move so you need to really give it a chance to capture it get it moment if it breaks the point of control for me then I'm happy to hold on to the trade cuz we are sat nicely yeah 4,200 so look how quick it's going I'm on four contracts on NASDAQ so I just got to be very careful with how she's moving she keeps sustaining this move to the upside then we are all good okay cool any questions ladies and gentlemen any questions any questions any questions questions question questions Google what x means yeah I heard about that Googling what x means something about his ex partner wanted deleted him off Twitter all right so he went and bought X he bought Twitter and had her completely removed what a guy what a guy that is like Flex that's the biggest Flex ever Tino on what L did you take the long cuz NASDAQ was taking a shoe bag to the downside it actually swept the Asian session low and the area that it was trying to move into was consistent with reversals so that's why I took the long on NASDAQ but I'm expecting it to hit the daily open do I want to hold on until that point I don't know but it's it's I've just got to really wait and see this stopping volume candle right here has given me a clue that she could come back down again but there's a rejection in that range so I've got to give it time to really make the move I do believe it's going to go back up I do believe it's going to shoot up in a few moments 25 to yeah I'm expecting them to try and take the daily open if it hits the daily open I'm out I'm done I'll be happy with that and even if it just continues to go up even more it doesn't matter to me because I wanted to see I only wanted to see it go up to my white line from my earlier long which was down here red Vector candle recovery Point Happy Days like that's all all we've got to do you know where we at hold on see now look they're holding at this point of control so this is going to give me more information about whether I should be holding this or not but anyways Bitcoin listen bitcoin's going to make a little dump but don't worry about that um yeah we're sorting that story out with the indicator T how did you cut out of the plastic wrap when you purchase your first set of scissors do you know what you actually got me thinking about that yeah we're sorting that out Daniel we're sorting that out we're sorting that out Daniel any other questions someone asked me about toilet paper before I'm like sorry I can't help you confirming the point of control that's why you buy two scissors what if both this I'm not having that conversation no stop it stop it no stop it Tino Euros is struggling to get above the daily open what are your thoughts on that look at the bigger picture of what's going on with Euro okay the Yen's going down Euro's coming down the Dollar's going up carry trade is on dollar going up NASDAQ moving up what are they doing putting dollars to work where what what do you buy a stock with dollars bonds are going down nasda going up right ladies and gentlemen here we go we're going to get the daily open test I'm going to do this with you all and then get rid here we go $6,000 free hit the daily open can we make it to 10 can it be a 10K day on this position come on make the move can we do it daily open take it it's a live account by the way just live account is active that's that's a live account come on make the move come on don't recover the vector don't recover the vector don't recover the vector do not recover the vector keep on going keep moving up y still got more steam Lor's Asian session High could be on the cards but I know NASDAQ likes to correct a little bit we got you know what we're out done I'll take that $685 not bad we put the trade on what time was the trade opened at um the trade was opened this morning orders I opened the trade this morning at I opened it about no I opened it here where was the entry point I don't understand I opened it here this morning it was in this range right here and I've still got the options trade open right now so that's 6,000 £6,000 in a profit so we finish it off right now we finish 12K for the day happy days and the markets and even done their move today all right now with that being said ladies and gentlemen if this Monday asan session goes down does that mean this week we'll be beish fundamentally you would expect that okay I explained the title of the video in the start of the live about the US debt itself and giving you the events on why there could be a us you know what I'm getting rid of my options trade I don't care that's it I'm done finished that was a options trade right there history right right there done call options Happy Days all right I'm finished no point in trying to get anything else from the market done that's it I'm not even going to attempt to trade anymore there's no point you know that's my what my target was for the day to try and at least make couple of grand I'm finished 12 now done there's no point that's what you do you pay yourself you get out of it it's over Bitcoin is crashing listen Bitcoin is not crashing man oh my days you call that a crash ladies and gentlemen listen if bitcoin's a leading indicator okay then this hourly candle itself in 20 minutes will establish a reversal if not then that means that the cost of the champagne is still expensive so they want it cheaper but the profile is building up so just pay attention to those lows I'm serious pay attention because if the NASDAQ can sustain itself and keep on moving up and it can break bitcoin's only going to do it I'm telling you look bit Bitcoin Bitcoin it does it there a St where it comes down keeps going down shoots back up to only come back down it's going to grab people's interest all right cool don't don't just don't just go long don't I'm serious don't just go long it's all about timing at the end of the day and it's all about what do you see happening at the lows of the range this is in the Brinks ladies and gentlemen I'm going to update the Platinum members now with a strategy on what they need to be looking for this in my opinion is a perfect br Brinks box okay it's a perfect Brinks go and take the free course you'll understand what I'm talking about with that with that being said ladies and gentlemen everything you

      "{'id': 2, 'datetime': '2024-10-22 18:12:11.732133', 'video_id': 'OIX8LC1hT1g', 'transcript': \"welcome ladies and gentlemen they're at it again man so another article has been released this time by the Euro zone They too are going to be attacking Bitcoin and if it gets to the point where everyone's thinking the same thing and usually it's going to actually play out you know the herd follows the herd kind of thing but today we're going to just talk about it and understand like does does the ECB have a point about Bitcoin I'm going to get into that article very very shortly can see we've got some interesting price action going across the board nasdaq's taking a little bit of a slump to the downside the yields are actually going up but as of play right now they are trading at Point yeah just they're trading negative but the bonds Market is up by 6% investors are effectively trying to now pricing the idea that maybe we're not going to get the interest rate cuts that we want we've got a fomc speaker coming into play in just short of an hour's time Mr Harker and he's going to be letting us know about what his story is on the interest rates followed by the Richmond Manufacturing Index which could be good news for the economy maybe maybe not but today we're going to dive into why subprime mortgage crisis of 20072 2008 could be repeating itself history doesn't repeat itself but it bloody does Rhyme you know so we're going to get into that story and I'm just going to deliver a few points about it all right we've got some data to back it up but again ladies and gentlemen and I know there's a question that keeps on getting asked to me Tino what price do you think this is going to end up at where do you think the Market's going to end up and what have you I mean look we'll get into that in this live but nonetheless let's get with the program break it all down and hopefully try and keep this live short and sweet he says that but anyways what's that comment yes the economy is bad even Trump is working in McDonald's these days that is funny let's get with the program ladies and gentlemen here we go so bonds slump globally as Traders rethink the fed's rate cut path right so the problem that we've got is if Trump does actually win then he's going to be looking at getting the tax cuts that's naturally going to cause infl to rise and that's the issue that we have it's already sticky as such it is going down currently at the 2.4% will the FED achieve that 2% mandated Target that they're looking for fundamentally if the economy is doing well then the FED doesn't really need to be cutting the interest rates because if the economy can sustain High interest rates then everything's all good then it's just going to be a case of time but let's just dive into something right now the housing market check this out so courtesy of Mike investing this chart right here is showing you Bank non-owner occupied and non-farm non-residential Loans past due and non-acral rates by asset size so who owes what we can see over here we've got ourselves a nice little climb right and that's in assets around $250 billion go over here to the left you can see the subprime mortgage crisis had pretty much the same story so all of a sudden we're seeing this big spike [Music] in something is brewing let's just back it up household financial debt to disposal income what are we seeing starting to go up ladies and gentlemen Financial Obligations they're costing more money it's making it harder for people especially with these interest rates let's go elsewhere house real estate loans go back in subprime mortgage crisis 20072 2008 you can see it's starting to top out in this range right here and now we've got this Behavior right here where you see real estate loans they're starting to just drop there's like no interest to top that off look at this housing prices look it's rising and it's actually exponentially exploded from this point around 2020 when money was cheap they now all got that money and now got all those liabilities and brought all those properties now the interest rates are really high it's going to kind of squeeze these people now especially these landlords what gives could we get another repeat from what 20072 2008 was cuz that's where that range is right there you can see but the that this was a steady climb this was an aggressive move up that is a problem major problem public debt for every dollar the US spends it owes 120% on top it doesn't earn enough which pretty much explains why gold is climbing now going into the stock market you can see that NASDAQ has taken a little bit of a tumble to the downside it swept the Asian session ranges on the five minute time frame going into the higher time frames you can see it's starting to just pull back ever so slightly but we do have news coming out very shortly which we have a look you can see Parker's going to be speaking soon and then the Richmond Manufacturing Index and lagarde's going to be speaking both will be having an impact on the US dollar going over into the US dollar right now to understand and where what' you know dollar is climbing and it's appreciating but this can usually lead to investors turning to the stock market all right because when your purchasing power of the dollar is good then they want to take advantage of that so that logic should say that assets against the US dollar like the euro and Bitcoin fundamentally should be trading lower we look at Bitcoin you can see Bitcoin is looking like it's edging to start rolling over we go over into the chart and have a look at Bitcoin in terms of liquidity and we can see that we do have oh we got some news here we go in the past hour 1,718 Traders were liquidated and the total liquidations come to around 2.89 million so that's not really good but then looking at the chart you can see here this is on 12-hour time frame you don't really have that many liquidation not liquidations but not many offers coming into play so they might not be looking to sell their Bitcoin which means that retail might not be looking at buying it but the smart money is going to start coming in and picking up and we got bids all the way down here don't really have that many bids we've got about 5 million down at the low 6 million right here at 66,000 itself so that could be a point of interest for Bitcoin going into today but what's really impacting bitcoin's price action itself well let me just explain to you this story right here look at this true declaration of war Bitcoin veteran says gloves are off after the ECB publishes paper for attacking Bitcoin what are they saying well in this paper it actually goes on to say that Bitcoin is no longer the reason or the re the purpose that Satoshi actually put it out for all it's doing is just taking money from the long-term well long-term holders and non holders that's all it's doing that means Traders so people who are speculating on bitcoin's price whether it's going to go up or down they're just like you know what forget it like I'm going to buy now and then I'm going to sell in a week's time or I'm going to buy here and then sell in a month's time time again we go back to the idea of okay Bitcoin you know what's it for again the collectors of Bitcoin they're going to end up seeing the frustrations in people's eyes where they're like they're buying the Bitcoin and it's not going to places where they expect it to now long-term holders like we're talking about the guys who have been stacked in Bitcoin from God knows what 20,000 10,000 even less than that okay but people are coming into Bitcoin now and they think that by the expense that it is at 67,000 nearly they think ah it's expensive for a reason that means it's going to keep on going higher and higher not necessarily and that's the issue that we've got so you already had the mapol federal department saying itself that Bitcoin itself is going to be a threat to the permanent primary deficit that means if investors are no longer interested in the US debt in terms of buying bonds they're going to turn to bitcoin well the FED doesn't want that then you got the ECB saying that they're not even doing it for the purpose that it was originally created for so is this fud fud fud no if you translate it as fud you're not seeing the bigger picture here all right I said last night that Bitcoin could be a problem in terms of the ETF all right if they were to ban Bitcoin or put a massive tax the only way that you're going to get access to bitcoin is via the ETF that right there is decentralization in the bin and that is the truth ladies and gentlemen all right if that was to be the case okay but does Bitcoin still have it in it that's the question now granted we do have Bitcoin at the highs the Asian session high right here could be posing as a bit of a risk for us in the sense but this could be the high of the week it could be the high of the week and it's all going to be based on how Bitcoin behaves inside of this range usually when the NASDAQ likes to make a little bit of a move to the upside that's when Bitcoin tends to follow but looking at NASDAQ I mean quite frankly NASDAQ has traded sideways going over into gold itself you can see that investors are just I mean look man it's just going up it's not stopping that red Vector candle's coming into play again and gold is just pricing in the idea of a safe haven but with that being said going over into the Yen looking at the Yen it's going down so what are they doing they they should be in fund fundamentally they should be putting the yen to work because the carry trade principle is active they're going down look it's going down into the vectors Yen should end up at 0.06 it should be and if they're exchanging Yen and putting it into dollars that logic would then suggest that they're going into what stocks so which is where the stock market principally should be going up and quite frankly is going up and then you go look at Bitcoin and then you say well Bitcoin why aren't you going up well bitcoin's a lower market cap in itself all right and that can be a bit of a problem now looking at Bitcoin in this current range today is a very important day for Bitcoin in the sense of ranges that means if Bitcoin cannot sustain itself above the Asian session high on Tuesday and not try and make an attempt towards the Asian session range on the Monday then as I said we could be in line for the high of the week and that is a problem for us cuz Bitcoin could come come all the way down and we do have Vector candles down below here at 62,000 but even if Bitcoin were to drop down there it's still in the same spot as it was from before so there's nothing really to be concerned about it's just in that accumulation zone go over into the daily time frame itself and then you say okay then what's the logic well the logic is this here is the 5 and 13 EMA and if the price can stay above the 13 EMA then technically the 13 EMA could be acting as a support mechanism all right that means the guys who have been going long or should I say been selling their Bitcoin right here might want to try and buy some more Bitcoin as it pulls back and then the block principle acts as an area of support so the logic could be that Bitcoin could come down to then try and make a reversal back up has he got every reason to do so of course it has why because you've got liquidity trapped look people are trapped up here the break even guys the guys who are like oh my God I went long at the highest point of the range I went long when they said it was going to pump to 100K these are your 100 kers right here and they are all stuck and the way the market works is it makes them believe that okay now that it's gone back to that point I'm going to stay holding on to that point because if they held on to it when it dropped all the way down here and then made a recovery back up it solidified them to keep a hold on that and then it forced it back down again Bitcoin is getting bullied which makes sense why this article is saying that it says it here look the um the ECB claims that BTC has strayed away from the original vision of Satoshi and the Creator and now exists to extract value from latecomers and nonh holders do you agree that's the case well what am I always saying pay yourselves pay yourselves are you a collector of Bitcoin or are you here to actually make money what's the point if you're a collector it doesn't matter what the price is you just like collecting it it's like people that buy stamps people who buy postcards and collect postcards all right or Pokemon cards like they get the best Pokemon card they can find they ain't selling it but everyone has their price that's the thing man let's go and have a look at some ranges right here but well let's just let's just do this for a second hold on here we go so here is our days range on bitcoin this is the daily profile and this is the 25-day profile by the principle of the 25-day profile Bitcoin is currently in the value area high okay so it's been in an area of value of high value for quite some time and it's going to require a lot of people to buy Bitcoin to sustain this area and that's this whole zone right here now looking at the days range you can see Bitcoin is close towards its point of control around 67,2 190 going down in the book I can see there's a a bag load I a lot of guys wanting to buy Bitcoin you got 353 contracts at 66490 another 311 at 66,1 190 so and there's a 347 down at 65990 so this tells us that there is interest from people to buy Bitcoin but then we scroll up we can see where is the selling well it doesn't look like that many people are selling and they're selling very close to what the current price point is so it's like they want to try and get their try and get their money in and sell their Bitcoin because they probably think that it's going to go down going up into the chart you can see you don't really have that much liquidity on the offer side so something good needs to happen to encourage retail to start being demanding and taking the liquidity from the guys that are looking to sell the Bitcoin okay look at that 765 million Bitcoin being transferred but it's going to unidentified wallets if it was going to an exchange fine but it's going to a wallet all right the reason for it who knows maybe it could be to do with the election who knows maybe with t with elon's Claim about you know he's going to give a million dollars to anyone who signs the petition okay could be using it in Bitcoin who knows that would then mean that would have to go to an exchange to seek liquidity so they're doing it very very you know on the sly that's very interesting you know but Bitcoin hasn't really done too badly it's doing all right so that means that 765 million is not really a problem for Bitcoin when you think about it in the grand scheme of things where the ETF itself has picked up nearly 20 billion Milestone looking at the ETF itself you can see that it is going to go into a gap down all right we got nearly at its all-time high close towards it for 42 going into the marketplace to have a look at where we are in that respect go to Nvidia where's Nvidia here we go Nvidia alltime High ladies and gentlemen closed at the all-time high it's not looking like it's going to be gapping down but looking at the out of orders Market I'm telling you now if you guys can get hold of the depth of Market on Nvidia I'm telling you now if you and listen you guys can do it all right if you go over to on EXO charts and you go to Dom all right and then you go to select pair and it gives you the options for stocks I I I think it's going to help you if anyone that does trade the NASDAQ it certainly helps me why do you understand what it is when someone comes in and wants to buy half a million or he's offering half a million shares of Nvidia all right this is what I did yesterday when I took the trades all right on the NASDAQ this is what I was looking at look at this so yesterday this was the logic here is and you can take this logic and apply it to bitcoin right here is the depth of market right that's the depth okay and here are the offers and here are the bids okay price was doing this all right there was a fat offer of 500,000 shares completely took the order book all right completely but Nvidia was down here at the 133 for example the half a million shares was at 140 say okay what I started to notice was there were some guys coming in and they were buying 5,000 2,000 1,000 and the Delta was suggesting that market aggressive Market orders were coming in and I was like surely they're going to want to go for that liquidity you can't come to the market and have half a million shares waiting to be sold the market naturally is going to gravitate to the nearest side of liquidity right that's where I took the Longs yesterday go and look at last night's live stream I took the Longs on the logic of Nvidia marking up and ladies and gentlemen she made that move and she cleared that liquidity and NASDAQ and S&P followed through and then they just continued to move up going into the close that's what you're getting when you're looking at this kind of stuff you're trying to understand the relationship of who's going to be coming in to buy who's going to be coming in to sell that's going to determine where Bitcoin is likely to end up at a specific point in time okay when you pay attention to the orders it's going to give you information now as a day trader it's great right right now you can see someone just planted an order right there 268 don't even know if you can see it 268 on a bid side they they stacked it that means they brought it into the book and they were like right quickly put this here put this here because I want to make sure it gets filled right that's that's support that's commitment okay then what we're looking for is we're looking for more of that commitment we want to see more people coming in saying right we want to buy we want to buy in terms of the bids okay and what that should do it should encourage people to sell look at how close the sellers are that's not a good sign we need the sellers to be dispersed we need lots more interest coming in and people wanting to sell more Bitcoin which which means people are going to come to the charts and be like okay what's Bitcoin doing let's go have a look at Bitcoin is it up is it down oh my God bitcoin's pumping oh wow retail retail very very shortly you should start seeing interest coming in oh someone's just planted a little order right there 83 I'm only interested in orders above 80 all right 171 at the top side of the profile going into the 25 day profile don't really see anything else my concern is I got too many bids down here 4 40 bids at the 66490 I need to see more people coming in buying it look they're loading up on the bid side this right here is is pulling and it's pulling and the it's the PS which is the pulling and the stack when it's a positive figure it means that they're adding they're stacking to the order book when it's a negative figure it's pulling from the book I mean someone comes along and says right quickly put 10 Bitcoin there yeah yeah go go go go no no no no no no no no no no pull it pull it pull it pull it pull it n stack it stack it put it in put it in put it in I want to get filled I want to get filled it's going up it's going up quickly get it get get it that's what that is right there likewise on the offer side what have we got here you got people pulling from the offers so 167 they're pulling away from the offers and the reason they' be pulling away from the offers is because they think you know what I can sell higher because there are guys loading up on the bids that means they're happy to buy at this point Okay cool so the logic says that if they're pulling away from the stack in if they're pulling away from the offers that means they're going to want to sell higher that means there could be interest coming in to buy Bitcoin from retail Market orders are taking it then that should lead Bitcoin to climb higher but you can see a point of control at 3,779 that is an area where most of the transactions have occurred in the day's profile so the logic would say that if we do get to that point and surpass it then we know that the support is there in Bitcoin at 67290 and if that's going to be the case Happy Days it goes up to that point and explodes away from it if it doesn't it will find resistance and then it will come back down again that's what you're having to deal with so then when you look at the Candlestick you think hm is that the case you know might sound like a lot to you all but this is how I'm using this this is how I'm breaking down the logic of Bitcoin going from one spot to the next okay but when you look at the massive picture of Bitcoin and you have that in the back of your mind you're going to be saying to yourself well what does the bigger picture suggest well we've just had a nice selling frenzy going off on bitcoin they've been selling okay because retails coming and started buying going into the liquidations you can see look people are getting smacked looking down here the total bars we've got quite a few shorts and long liquidations but not anything as aggressive zooming out on this on the 12 hour time frame you can see we've had quite a few short liquidations at the same time quite a few long liquidation sorry um yeah we've had more short liquidations coming into play more shorts so the logic would say that we're going to want to try and attack some of those long liquidations now this is going to be over a period of time all right but when you're trying to siphon out what Bitcoin is likely to do next look at the day's range look at that Candlestick so you're really working with this take the high take the low take the low sorry take the high take the low that's your range and you've got to try and work out they've tried to reject that point they've rejected it and they've started to work their way up I did decide to start buying inside of this point right here then I really need to be taking profits as Bitcoin tries to trade positive because it could find resistances again from the same area that it opened that where it dropped down and that in my opinion is how you really want to understand and look at Bitcoin for trying to make money from it you know yeah we got green Vector candles down here and we would expect them to come back down to those points at some instance I would expect that from Bitcoin unless Bitcoin prints a green Vector Candle on the daily time frame the logic is that Bitcoin is going to roll over but if they can sustain this 5 and 13 EMA and move away from it then it's all good remember you're not you're dealing with information that you don't know about all you know is what you see but you've got to also react to what is happening that's what trading is all about when you get that married in your mind properly then you'll be like that makes sense so you shouldn't have any bias about price you shouldn't care you should care about what it does as opposed to who believes it should be or what it won't be or why it should be look at who's prepared to buy and sell it that in my opinion is going to serve you and that's EXO charts you know any questions can pulling also mean that someone had a large order sitting and lost faith that price would reach that point Ergo Ergo Market Market order to replace a limit order technically yeah when someone pulls from the book okay when they're pulling away from the book it tends to mean that they don't want to get that price filled it could also mean a spoof where it's a fake order all right and you will see so many of those on the NASDAQ and the S&P you'll see loads of them on the NASDAQ they do it all the time on the depth of Market loads of times like I mean if I just pull this up here on the NASDAQ this is the um the tick chart and right now we' look so right now NASDAQ is moving away from an area of value oh the point of control has just changed that is very important so there's more activity in here so something's Brewing here is it going to tell me there's more sellers or is there more buyers but the point of control has just changed from where it previously was so this is the am of time they've spent in the value area low so you can see that they don't really want to spend that much money in those areas anymore so the logic says that we should see the NASDAQ making a move to the upside and moving away from this point okay so that's where it gets very very interesting for me very interesting for me they can sustain this low and go back into that logic oh wow red candle green candle formation stoping volume candle I mean it's a very interesting Brinks box but we do have news coming out very very soon which will decide exactly what the story is for the NASDAQ and that's exactly the same for Bitcoin okay any thoughts on xrp go away I'm not talking about no xrp all right listen quick one for you all you guys going to join this btcc and take advantage of the eth two eth giveaway like end of the month giving away to ethereum if you don't want the ethereum let me know cuz then I can have it it's simple as that we don't have anyone doing it me and Mike will split it 05 guaranteed to platinum members all right that doesn't mean that when you become a platinum member you will get 05 guaranteed ethereum that's not what that says you'll be eligible to win it right and then 1.5 theorem will be given away to three people and that's going to be done at the end of the month we're going to I think the 1st of November when we actually do declare it all all right so to take part in that all you need to do is just join btcc everything's in the description of the live stream and that's where you get this stuff here here we go so great for anyone that doesn't want kyc 225x leverage be careful with the leverage but you can also trade the NASDAQ and the S&P through btcc and stocks and all of that gag as well you can use trading View it's connected with trading view but if you want to trade NASDAQ for anyone that does ask the question NASDAQ is Tech 100 right there and the S&P is spx500 you got Netflix micro strategy coin meta and Nvidia and gold and silver frankly that is the best place for you to hedge if you're in a position in crypto and you can see Gold's making a move up get onto the gold Happy Days silver also in there you've got Amazon declaring their earnings very soon you could take positions on Amazon have a look at where they are in terms of the options Market who's favoring higher prices for Amazon who's favoring lower prices and just play that game you can do that all on btcc okay now with that being said ladies and gentlemen any other questions how will you know we are Platinum members for the eth giveaway well if you're a platinum member we were going to do the check we're going to check we're going to pull up all our Platinum members list and we're going to pull out Happy Days remember um do you prefer box bro you are you guys ask some very special questions if you ate past and did you notice over time that the market makers getting sneaker and cunning how to screw with us with more crypto ta guys like yourself and their job getting harder isn't it greetings from Ireland mad love bro all right listen um when you have a perspective change on the way assets move like this is why I trade NASDAQ because fundamentally it's all about who buys and who sells and I can see that information when I'm looking at the depth of market right now I can see that's the point of control why is NASDAQ not breaking down from it just yet maybe because that's where most of the volume is currently being transacted that so usually NASDAQ will create a profile and say 70% of the time it will stay around the point of control then we then see a trending day where the profile will change if we just zoom out and have a look at that in terms of profile it would be the TPO okay so you'd be looking at this but I've split it up on the chart if I just go get rid of that just for the nature of demonstration click that and get rid of that there you go so there's your TPO right there so that's a volume profile in principle so what have I got well it looks like we've got ourselves a normal distribution that's the point of control of the TPO right there and that's effectively oh sorry no here we go so this is like it's like a a trend but it's actually a run for stops so there's lots of people in Longs and then they just made them pay the price for it okay so if all those guys that have got gone in long has been liquidated what have they done they've said you know what let's go short cuz nasc's going to collapse Okay cool so you just come from the point of control it changed from being over here and now it's come down to here so what's that telling me that's telling me value is currently sat in that point and that's where there could be interest to see NASDAQ try and climb up on the back of the guys who' have been running shorts on NASDAQ the bonds Market is down that's what they're saying they're slumping so people are coming to the marketplace with a negative outlook now we've got NASDAQ looking like it wants to make a pump it's the best time the green and red and green Vector candle this is consistent with a reversal strategy in principle well if they really are struggling about the marketplace NASDAQ should be dropping they swept the Asian session range we should see it climb back up that's it so here's an example of me hedging right I took a on the NASDAQ which saw a draw down okay so I'm in a draw down on the NASDAQ of $1,370 it's going up and down but I also took a long on the S&P which is effectively paying for that okay so I'm going to wait and see how the day is going to farare out all right because the market is just open right now I'm going to be paying attention to Nvidia to see where the orders are but as long as Nvidia starts going up again today I'm assuming that the NASDAQ and the S&P will follow suit okay so I've got a threshold on this I'm waiting waiting to see how it plays if NASDAQ can sustain itself andp sustains itself it's going to keep on going up Happy Days okay at this time in the marketplace this is where it gets a little bit crazy okay I'm going to have to get myself very very carefully here hold on look at that just look at the way it's moving yeah this is the Brinks man this is the craziest time to have positions open but I'm not really risking that much here we go look it's going back into that there's that moving away from the point of control it could actually sweep lower make another sweep to try and reverse but they're at the lows of the profile so this is where it gets very in oh Violet Vector so that's something that can say to me maybe we could see a reversal but there's lots of activity going off in here quickly going over into Nvidia where you at Nvidia how's Nvidia fairing so Nvidia has gapped up but no sorry it's gap down but they'll be filling the yeah they're just picking up beds yeah there's nothing I'm not too concerned about that that's what they do this is how they do it just quickly going over into gold um dollar dominance that seems to be doing its thing is the yields going up bonds are going up that's good news we want to see the bonds going up the yields coming down that's good so when the yields go down and the bonds go up there's like a change in risk and then we just got to sit tight and wait for that risk to adjust basically okay a lot of conspiracy theorists and doom and glooms are calling for a Black Swan before the election what would you say to that PE to to that to people who are currently in leverage positions mad love watching every day okay this is what I say to you all expansion contraction it's all there all of that chart right there Black Swan events you name it it's all there okay expansion contraction we've been expanding for quite some time okay we need a contraction that's what we need that's how the economy Works remember the stock market has successfully recovered every single crash in the past right so when we get a contraction do you have the ability to sit through the draw down that's all it is the housing market could be the problem right just as we said earlier on look where is it there she is that's a problem the last time this started to rise was subprime mortgage crisis just before it started so it's one of those stories ladies and gentlemen what's Nasdaq doing NASDAQ is going I'm telling you now NASDAQ is a nut job it's an absolute nut job ladies and gentlemen you have to be on crack to trade NASDAQ but anyways with that being said ladies and gentlemen I've got to get an update out to the guys before the Brinks box is created please trade safely it's going to be a crazy day we do have Harker speaking very very shortly but nonetheless take take advantage of that two ethereum giveaway everything you need is in the description of this live stream other than that guys please please trade safely take money out of the markets and I'll be tuning into you all later tonight all right take care yourselves gang mad love

      "{'id': 3, 'datetime': '2024-10-23 16:20:29.654254', 'video_id': '40-_kPs6oNU', 'transcript': \"so that's the question that we've got on our minds is are or all of them overvalued what do you mean to you know well are stocks overvalued well in this live stream I'm going to be talking about a specific indicator that has been used in the past and it always seems to be relevant when you see assets like stocks appreciate so aggressively given in these current times as well when it's absolute Madness going off but I believe that this is just an election play but what you understand is this right Trump's new policies that he's going to be putting out if he were to win given that everybody thinks that he is going to win that's going to have an impact on inflation massively now you got asked the question why is Elon and Trump like what's this relationship all about well youve got to look at it like this Trump wants to tax of course overseas investors businesses he wants to put tariffs on China now when you put tariffs on China that means it's going to be a bit of a problem for people in China but then when you've got companies that have to work with companies in the US it's going to cause a little bit of a problem which means that Elon where most of his business could be conducted from the use of Chinese products he might say to Trump look man just go easy on the tariffs a little bit because it's going to kind of hurt the way we do business maybe that's why he's getting into bed with Elon Elon is a PO popular figure and he's got the support of millions and millions of people around the world and you know it only makes sense but it's going to be interesting to see if it actually does come into play because ultimately with Trump and the tax reforms as such it's going to impact inflation and whatever look he wants to cut taxes all right cool but the consumer will naturally absorb that in the future okay so it sounds great but it's going to be a bit of a problem and that's going to be a problem for us all when you think about it which leads me on to today's topic about stocks being overvalued what we're going to do is we're going to talk about stocks being overvalued excuse me and we're going to talk about how that can impact Bitcoin quite frankly I don't think Bitcoin is going to do much until at least the start of the new month within the week of the 1 of November give or take a few days before maybe afterwards I think bitcoin's going to go for that volatility as we get closer and closer to the election itself we might get some nice flavor to the upside and I'm going to be justifying why now it's not no negative outlook ladies and gentlemen I'm just telling you that the same way you guys believe that stocks can be undervalued is the same way you should be accepting that they can be overvalued what narrow mind would only think that stocks can only be overvalued for sustained periods of time well we're going to break it all down for you so you can understand that concept once we're done with that we're going to break down a little bit of Bitcoin price action and understand exactly what we've got going off with Bitcoin I'm looking at the profiles today to try and establish exactly what could actually happen we have Tesla with their news announcements and their earnings coming out and did you see what happened to Starbucks Starbucks got a slap across the face with their quarterly earnings decelerated and if you watched last night's live stream where we were talking about what to look for with regards to stocks an acceleration in earnings each quarter is going to be a helpful thing for that stock but Starbucks hasn't really seen that much success with that so we're going to be diving into that story when we get into the live so with that being said ladies and gentlemen what do you think about Quantum stock is it a good time to buy it I don't know about Quantum stock but let's just get with the program and understand exactly what we are dealing with with today you heard this about JP Morgan tempering Revenue optimism that's very interesting like they're making it look like everything is good but looking at their Bank assets Central Bank assets they're offloading those bad boys then that would make sense though wouldn't it central banks offloading their assets they're selling this chart kind of gives you an idea about it when the Blue Line sets and it hits an extreme those extremes are usually consistent with Market tops and bottoms the one extreme that we are heading towards is where retail is dumb money which is the red line they are actively buying blue line is smart money selling the idea is that we're still going to see some more movement to the upside this is why I'm saying Bitcoin will hit its alltime high NASDAQ will claim its um alltime high again and S&P will then surpass 6,000 that effectively means that we've got a lot of activity coming into play over the next few weeks we've got the election that's going to bring wild volatility the market in principle should be pricing in the idea if he thinks that Trump's going to win then of course we're going to see the markets continue to go up people are going to be excited about Trump winning it's going to be happy days and what have you so I listen some of you might not be happy with the idea of it Trump he's not this he's done that he's lied this he's lied that but he is a businessman and you've got a better chance with a businessman or Harris I mean that's just my opinion whether you like to hear it or not like what are what are Harris's accolades and this is a question they're always asking and listen it impacts me because it's going to tell me what my narrative is whether I should be invested in gold or silver or not depending on who's going to be leading the United States okay so when the interest rate start to get cut in the US Gold starts to go up and look at gold as long as we've got a war going off Gold's going to keep on going up how's that going to impact me well look if we get Trump coming into play he wants to achieve uh oil to get down to $50 a barrel then that tells me that the stock market is going to keep on going up under Trump's power because when oil goes down stocks go up when oil goes up stocks go down this is something you've got to take into consideration it's not a case of oh I just like Trump because I like Trump that's not the point here the point here is how's it going to impact me moving forward with me trading with me investing like why would I want to be invested in Gold I'm already invested in Gold it's going up that's happy days but I'm playing a macro with gold gold can only go up for so long before there's going to be a change in the way hedge fund managers are going to be managing their exposure right now they're selling and this chart right here is is suggesting that they are selling it and that's why NASDAQ is making a move down right now but you are very close to your all-time high and with the earnings announcements today from Tesla I mean we've got Tesla a results not results but we can see in the out of ours markets Tesla is gapping down and we do have a huge gap right here that we would logically assume Tesla is going to try and fill but this is going to be a market mve ladies and gentlemen because in the calendar itself we we've not only got Tesla we've got IBM as well and IBM if we just go into the history of that then we get into the idea of whether stocks are overvalued or not you just go and search for IBM right now you'll understand if IBM are doing really well in terms of their earnings so let's just have a look at how they've been so on a quarterly quarter basis you can see that from December 23 um yeah December quarter 23 they had earnings of 8% and 4% in sales going to the next quarter they had an earnings of 24% and only 1% on sales and then in the quarter after that it's 11% in earnings and 2% in sales so there's no real consistency in the quarterly earnings it's still positive but there's no acceleration cuz then that can lead to the idea that there's not that much demand it could be seasonal it could be they had one big contract coming into play where they ordered lots and lots of IBM equipment and that obviously led to the earnings of and the sales to be much in December and not as much in in um in June 2024 so it's going to be a very important time for IBM and given that it is not so much a massive market cap given that it's inside of the tech Market that's going to have an impact on the way NASDAQ is going to be moving but one thing you do need to take into consideration ladies and gentlemen with regards to stocks being overvalued if you look at this chart you can see that is it really overvalued or in other words is this just being motivated by climatic movements in other words are we at a blowout top look at the volume on the bottom right here of the NASDAQ it's rising as price is rising and NASDAQ has yet to break out okay so you can see when volume is rising above average which is this bottom Red Line right here that tells you there's accumulation and that accumulation ladies and gentlemen is no it's it's all down to Nvidia okay and Nvidia itself is the leader it really is look at it's forming the same structure as NASDAQ it's already broke its alltime high again okay and the problem I've got with Nvidia is this on the weekly time frame I ain't seeing volume above average that's the issue I've got so then that means that even though Nvidia could be leading NASDAQ it means that with nasdaq's volume coming in above average means that most of the stocks in the NASDAQ are in accumulation but now that leads me over to the idea of this story over here check this out we got two things this is the buffer indicator which suggests that the value of stocks and just to simplify it it's how valued or how overvalued or how undervalued are stocks in the US Stock Market well right now we've just hit 200% and that's the first time in history a clear riew of the actual chart itself is right here now this is really important for anyone that wants to understand the value of stocks for every Peak that you've seen so far so in 2000 we had 136.6 increase in the valuation of stocks back in time in history you can see 1970 we had an 80% increase okay and then it corrected from there and then 136% just before 2000 and then bang it drops then you get another 104% bang it drops and then we go up now 129% September 2017 what happens from that point what happened from 20 2017 onwards well back when they declared there was $252 billion worth of unrealized losses on banks statements and their balance sheets well that led to the sub the the actual market crash of 2018 so going into this chart right here now we're at 200% oh the market will be fine yeah don't worry it's overvalued and that's why Warren Buffett has got rid of a lot of stock and he's sitting in a lot of cash don't worry about it 200% is fine it's just going to keep on going because that's exactly what we're dealing with because this time it's different oh man come on is it really different this is the most frustrating thing about it all ladies and gentlemen it's it's it's it's going to be a problem for us with stocks being so overvalued now going into the story about Trump's economic plan it will worsen inflation it really will and then we could go back to the idea of 1968 when they had to increase the interest rates when they paused there could be a possibility that could actually happen but we go into the idea of what's going on with Bitcoin now let's just understand something okay this is where we are right now with Bitcoin okay these are the ETF inflows looks nice and green doesn't it which is why I'm saying that Bitcoin by the time around first few days after or before the 1st of November I'm expecting Bitcoin to do a very significant move like I'm looking for some flavor in Bitcoin okay the thing is that it might not be doing too much right now I've got certain projections that I'm expecting Bitcoin to try and achieve this week purely off the volatility of what news announcements could be coming out but going into the calendar you can't really see much happening other than the manufacturing data and the unemployment claims that will be coming out tomorrow today we've got the Bank of Canada press conference and Bank of England Bailey speaking so not really that much of a big Market mover but if you're going to be trading oil it'll be something that you want to be paying attention to because naturally when the US dollar goes up against the Canadian dollar oil kind of does suffer a little bit on that and when the Canadian dollar is doing well oil tends to do well because they are one of the largest producers or exporters of us oil per se okay so it's going to be an interesting one to see what happens going into today at half past 3 but nonetheless we don't really have that much else going on in the calendar other than the Tesla earnings quickly going into the day itself with low impact news announcements we do have Crudo inventories which is going to be an interesting one then we've got lagard speaking and existing home sales now existing home sales is projected to come in higher okay so that's going to be very interesting given that house price are rising quite aggressively it's going to be interesting to see if those figures do come in and show that house prices are going up and people are buying houses all right because if people are buying the homes then boy this economy is not just robust it is the best in the world so now let's just understand how this can impact cryptocurrency and Bitcoin overall so look at this says here that is Bitcoin Bull Run coming and a golden cross versus a treasury yields analysis fundamentally what you've got to understand is this this okay the you the federal government all right so the the Federal Reserve has this thing called permanent primary deficit which means we can keep on borrowing money keep borrowing keep borrowing and that's Happy Days why because we sell that debt and people can invest in that debt and generate a return what's the 2-year yield the 10-year yield and the US 10 10year bonds Market it's one of the most traded markets out there and it's a safe haven for some investors given that it is 100 about $137 trillion worth of market cap a lot of money goes into into this Marketplace because it's ideal for investors who want to hedge themselves do they want low risk or do they want fixed income returns that's all they do with the bonds now the problem that we have is this Bitcoin is a threat to that story and the US won't be able to maintain a fixed or permanent primary deficit if you've got Bitcoin rolling about which is why they're trying to ban it okay now coupled with the Banning of Bitcoin itself you can appreciate that the ETFs themselves they're not going to stop okay but it does give us the idea that if they were to ban Bitcoin to the local man then bigger players like Black Rock would be able to take advantage of that now black Black Rock has now surpassed micro strategy in terms of Bitcoin holding it's currently set up 350 there you go 392,000 Bitcoin 121 that is wild given that black rocks only been in the space since January 20 yeah since the ETF itself all right so they've surpassed micro strategy and micro strategy is only the fifth largest holder and all that hype about micro strategy and he's not even the largest holder well never mind that's something else but black rock is using hard cash to buy it okay so and given that it has its largest amount of Holdings you got to say to yourself how long can Black Rock being a draw down for but you got to remember Black Rock will not hesitate to sell the Bitcoin that's the truth and that's what you got to get into your minds it's black rock is Wall Street mentality now to look at the bigger picture of things if Bitcoin right if Bitcoin does compromise this story about primary um permanent primary deficit which means that the US government effectively or the Federal Reserve allows debt to be accumulated nonstop what does it mean in terms of Treasury yields well effectively it's this if you go over to the yields Market itself this is what goes off the bonds right now 97 okay so what are you getting if you buy 10-year bond market well you go over to the 10-year yields and you will pick up 4.2% awesome so go and give the US government $10 million that's what the rate of return that you'd be achieving okay happy days what about a 2-year well the 2 year is coming in at 4% as well so I've not got an inversion on the yield that's great news for me so that means if I give the US government some money they are going to give me a return of 4% so who wins well the US government wins why because the money that I'm going to be giving to the US government is effectively going to be put to work so that the government can make a return on it I know I'm going to get 4% whatever they make on top of that happy days is given to the government so they they earn off the back of that okay when you got Bitcoin Bitcoin compromises that why because the reason why the yields are going up is because no one's interested in buying the bonds looks like they're interested in the stock market looks like they're interested in Gold it looks like they're interested or you'd assume they're interested in Bitcoin and Bitcoin challenges that this is probably why Bitcoin isn't making that much of a move because it's like they don't want to scare Monger people don't want to make the Federal Reserve think hold on this is a problem for us because if no one's interested in buying the bonds that's kind of like like that's not good for the us remember they earn the the they earn less every time they borrow remember $1 that is spent okay or made should I say the FED owes 120% on top so Bitcoin compromises that really badly because investors will be like what 4% I ain't going to put 10 million in that all right it's fixed it's low investment I'm going to go over to bitcoin I'm going to take advantage of what Bitcoin can give in terms of returns but the problem with Bitcoin is it's too volatile for some investors which is why I'm saying about this cultural thing about Bitcoin once you get people into the idea that maybe bitcoin's a little bit stable like xrp there may be Bitcoin could actually be a place that people can plant money in and maintain the idea of store of value but bitcoin's too volatile for that which is why Bitcoin hasn't got that title just yet maybe and I believe this that Bitcoin needs to be so expensive for it to be ideally the the logic of a store of value what's an example of store of value well you just go over to Burkshire and haway stock okay BRK we go BRK come on Berkshire and hathway all right so let's just go with that one nearly $700,000 a share that's a store of value $700,000 nearly daily volume around 3,000 shares a day average daily volume 1500 be exact but it's look at that it's a store of value all day every day you can have a house on the stock market okay you would if you were to go and buy Bitcoin say for example Wales okay where they're buying millions of dollars worth of bitcoin every time Bitcoin goes down they should be getting rid of their Bitcoin holding and planting them into this and then wait until the market starts to pick up again and then naturally take advantage of Bitcoin and load up again and come back into here this is a store of value it really is and some of you might think no it's not all right tell me why it's price otherwise this is a store of value look at how it moves where's the volatility there is none bare Vol minimum volatility that's the logic that I'm coming up with I think Bitcoin needs to be really expensive before it can actually really grab the idea of a store of value now we've got this thing here we've got indications of a bullish move by Arc analyst so Bitcoin is now breaking out of this range of this well this was published a little while ago but he says Bitcoin bounced off its 200 day moving average on its short-term holder cost basis on Friday it seems to be breaking out of a broading broadening wedge that began to develop since March Okay so let's just go to the price point of that to understand that logic so it's breaking out of that 68 Zone okay so the breakout hasn't really worked out so it looks like they let me okay so am I drawing that correctly no I'm not drawing it correctly um all right just just for the nature of demonstration here okay so this is what you've got you've got this and they originally the breakout happened here okay so yeah baby Bitcoin to the Moon bang it's coming down okay but the green Vector candles are there right so you would already know that this is retail up here buying the idea of a breakout and now it's coming back down towards what could be a vector candle recovery to the downside this is the daily time frame it's going to take a little while for it to achieve bitco is going to go up and down up and down and then it's going to roll in that phase okay but it's still okay it's not bad we're very close to the alltime high ladies and gentlemen the all-time high is not far away just having a look at where the current price point is to the alltime high Bitcoin is only 10% a couple of days ago it was around 6% away from it or 11% away from the alltime high that is nothing for Bitcoin all right nothing for Bitcoin that's no problem for it because it can actually come back and make those gains it's had like 5 6% gains in one day all right even 12 15% we've seen before so it's not any volatility that Bitcoin is not familiar with okay but I do believe that as we get closer and closer to the election the reality of trump winning means that the market will price that in nasda will break out everything will go crazy okay and then when the policies start to come into play That's when we're going to start seeing the market correcting back go by the principle of this story here with the buffer indicator go by the principle of this image right here which is the stock forward price to sales ratio the last time it hit that point okay it corrected and that was in the 2000.com bubble crisis and then look where we are right now but again as I said don't don't it's not bad news guys don't worry okay it's just fundamental facts that the market expands and corre corrects okay and if you you don't like the idea of hearing bad news which is not bad news I'm just saying to you the stock market is overvalued which is why Warren buffer ain't buying nothing and he's sat in cash and if you don't like the sound of hearing that then why are you in this game in the first place why are you involved in trading you got to really be questioning your ability as a Trader if you're thinking that only everything can only go up all right let's just hold on a second let's let's just take that logic and just look at this okay so this is the stock market okay and to be fair L and gentlemen everything does only go up that's the thing all right but what you've got to understand guys is it goes up and it does come back down a little bit for it to come back up again so I accept that and if you can't accept that it can come back down a little bit I'm not saying it's going to drop down and completely collapse I mean let's just look at the last Corrections of the S&P itself one of the biggest Corrections was of course the well I'm not going to talk about that market crash but let's just go to the soprime mortgage crisis 2011 20072 2008 what did that bring that brought a % decrease in valuation of stock so the next market crash in principle was around yeah not so much a big crash but it did see a correction of around 16% no problem then we go over to this one right here which was a bit of a top out and it was the crash of the stock market in 2018 which saw a 20% correction and then we go into another crash right here which says that we've got a nice 35% correction in the stock market then we saw this little crash right here which was the move all the way down 26% decrease right there and this one's not exactly a crash but now we've just expanded away from that point and taken alltime high so historically it looks like you do get around 16 to 20% maybe 15 to 25% Corrections in the stock market why is that a problem tell me why that's bad someone did say to me Tina you got to be optimistic about things because that's the only way people are going to follow you or they're going to you know subscribe to the channel because they you know they only want to hear good news get out of this business if you only want to hear good news because it ain't going to be good when you put your money down and then you're losing money and then you're scratching your head wondering why am I buying at the market top you need both sides of the story you have to then you would say at least you have made an informed decision do you understand the risks of where we are right now we're all waiting for Bitcoin to make a move to the upside not going to lie we're all waiting for it we want that move I get it hope pm indicat yeah baby look like put your indications go to the the the followers or the guys or the YouTubers who all say bitcoin's going to do it bitcoin's going to do it yeah baby but you know I'm I'mma give you facts I'mma give you facts just to justify and if you don't like the facts get the out of this game seriously it's not built for you the get rich quick Adventurer will die poor don't come to this game trying to make quick money yesterday it doesn't work like that you've got to absorb the good and the bad it's this is the nature of the game you have to and when you're aligned with that like this here Assets in banks are going down there's not that much accumulation right now what's the story I mean you could assume there's accumulation because there these bars are actually increasing but I don't see no accumulation from Banks well they need to make money first and look at that and then you've got JP Morgan tampering with Revenue to make it look good just to retain the shareholder again see what I mean again it's like I got to retract on what I said even JP Morgan's trying to meddle with its books just to keep everyone happy forget that man stop trying to keep everyone cheerful and happy wake up man doesn't make sense things go down to go up things go up to come down if you're aligned with that you ain't going to get smacked in this business but if you enjoy that kind of thing fine I'm not the guy for you I'm going tell you yeah it could go up it could go down this could lead to a problem this could lead to a good thing this could lead to a problem look youve got conflicting stories here Tino tell me Bitcoin up or down well look black Rock's buying lots of Bitcoin okay let's go and buy Bitcoin Bitcoin then takes a shoe bag for the next three days and drops oh Tino you said that you know it was good news but wasn't really good news bro it's like oh man it bores the life out of me in good news though rip there the SEC has missed the deadline there you go so that means we could be seeing some volatility in xrp going over into xrp right now anyway go back to bitcoin so then we're just just it's just there for you guys you don't like what I say I'm sorry get out of this industry if you don't like what someone says not because you think I'm a bear forget that why is it important that you know that the stock to ratio the market cap GDP is at 200% first time ever does that not say something to you does he not say that we are overvalued I could say that Bitcoin is overvalued but then we go into the crypto mindset Bitcoin ain't overvalued it's undervalued but you understand what it means in the next quantile model that says that Bitcoin is going to go to 135,000 well if bitcoin's going to go to 13 million Bitcoin is chump change right now is that what you want to hear remember guys you're buying Bitcoin okay you're putting money up and you'll go through several videos on YouTube to work out who's optimistic about Bitcoin and then you'll add them together then you'll say you know what I'm going to do it that guy said about the tri angle that quantile model came in and said that Bitcoin is going to go to 135,000 year okay what else who else has said it oh he's in a long on bitcoin I'm going to do it okay you have that mindset cool but then we take the other guy he comes into this live stream and he's like well look interest rates they they're relatively High the yields are moving up bonds are going down stock market is at alltime highs stock ratio is showing that stocks are very over valued bitcoin's been following the stock market for some time um the economy has been expanding quite aggressively given that we've got such high interest rates inflation is still popping its head there could be some more inflation coming into play which means that Trump wins that we might actually have a problem with that in the future which could lead to interest rates being increased um but Bitcoin doesn't seem to be doing too well in the sense where it's not going up but it's not going down maybe this could be accumulation it could go off in a bit of a pop off which would be in line with what the nasdaq's doing could be getting ready to take an alltime High um Bitcoin could do that it's only 11% away from its high well I've got to look at it logically and say okay then even though everyone's all pumped about Bitcoin and not really giving me a reason to believe there's there's something happening with Bitcoin other than black rock is buying the ETF and people are earning and they're earning off the revenue of that all right then so what what's going to make me believe that I should be buying Bitcoin at this point well holders I've got something for you if you're purchase Bitcoin based on time then you'd probably make more money in the future when I say that I mean if from now you buy Bitcoin you are trading the election that's what you're doing that's the only event that we've got coming up you're trading the election once the election comes in bitcoin's made the move to the upside people will be of the logic that Bitcoin is breaking out of this little structure right here and it's going to continue to go up to the upside but then they're complaining that Trump's policies are going to lead to higher inflation logic would sayit coin should be going up because it is deemed as the Hedge against inflation well no gold is the Hedge against inflation because the dollar is going up and gold is going up that means the purchasing power of the dollar is being put to work and the idea is investors are a little bit scared so gold is going up and we've got ourselves a war so why isn't Bitcoin making the move it's got everyone asking the same question you get one little break of a triangle and then bang that's it Bitcoin is going to keep going because the triangle's broken ultimately ladies and gentlemen if you add weight to why you're going to buy or sell Bitcoin if you use time and say from now until the election whatever money I can make off Bitcoin I'm going to take it because historically the markets need to contract debt is a problem for the US it's something that need basically what I'm saying to we're building up to an event that's going to lead to a correction we need a correction man it can't just keep on going up like that we're not in an environment where it's statistically favorable for assets to appreciate so much it doesn't make sense what I'm saying to you is if you can get yourself cash flow and you're selling as the rallies are coming into play when retail's buying and buying you're going to be one of the few people and the volatility index shoots to 60 for example you're going to be buying everything up on the cheap and then you'll go on to the next expansion because it has to reset look at the corrections in the stock market look how infrequent they are they don't really spend that much time correcting do they look how fast it was look what happened on the 5th of August the correction from the Japanese Yen increasing the interest rates bang it came down and then it just shot back up from that point that's my logic ladies and gentlemen and if you like it you like it if you don't like it never mind I'm still going to be Trading that's the truth let's get into some bitcoin price action here we go where are we sorry for the rant ladies and gentlemen if you are new to the channel it'd be nice if you subscribed and you like the live stream and if you didn't like it then sorry but I ain't going to sell you no BS story I'm really not I'm not going to tell you what you want to hear because you just like to hear good things that's not the way life works and the brutality of this gameing trading especially especially trading you ain't going to get that you know Bitcoin is not a hedge a hedge against inflation it's a stock interesting once again it breaks 73k many will be trapped again because they took no profits correct I believe all of that I believe it we're going to get the same repeat as what happened in 19 in sorry in when Bitcoin hit 65k in the first place everyone that's broken that everyone that's got broke even on bitcoin so anyone that's been buying Bitcoin up here okay for example the alltime high on bitcoin right let's just go over to it if anyone was been buying Bitcoin at this all-time high right God's sake right anyone buying Bitcoin at this point is waiting for Bitcoin to go back into profit once it gets into profit or break even they will then retain themselves and say you know what I'm holding on because it means bitcoin's going to keep on going now I've sat through all of this draw down okay and they will keep their positions open and then Bitcoin will Trail up a little bit more and then it will come back down again but then it will force them to get back into the mindset of being able to hold the draw down because they were there before that's when Bitcoin will drop down aggressively okay and it will shake those guys out and then just straight make the move back up again that's the way the game works now let's get into the charting mode here we go what we got Bitcoin doing well let's firstly go over to the NASDAQ what's NASDAQ been doing nasdaq's been taking a shoe bag to the downside what time we are okay Tesla earnings and all that stuff that's Happy Days so we'll just pay attention to that I'm not in any positions right now I've got no trades open because I'm waiting to see what the nasdaq's going to do in this area here um going into bitcoin price action just having a look We've Come Away from the session range red Vector candle we got a green Vector candle happening over to the left of the chart which is a bit of a problem so let's just understand where we are with the order flow so where are we H not very good so look this is the profile for the day's range and what the day range says to me is we've only been able to build a value area high so that means people have been spending Bitcoin and been buying Bitcoin at premium prices and they haven't really spent that much time doing so which is this purple area right here but we haven't got a value area low and usually when the market gives you this profile it kind of makes you think hold on a second what what do I need to understand about the profile of the bids and the offers which is the offers of the red and the bids of the blue bids is where passive buyers are coming in red is where limit passive sellers are and the only way that price moves is if there's someone aggressively coming in taking orders okay so looking at the bids and the offers you can see that we've got some dudes down here are happy to buy Bitcoin around the 60,000 66,000 Zone that's going to be a very important area and you've got them adding to the profile as you see that 2011 orders planted there and you got 236 on the book you got 354 orders right there with 67 on the book waiting to be filled so they're adding so they're stacking to the order flow which means that's 400 contracts right there on bitcoin and then we go further down you got even more contracts on the bid side so it shows that people are looking to support Bitcoin if it does pull back down because they're going to be buying up Bitcoin as it goes lower the offers aren't really coming into play again because yesterday what we saw was Bitcoin did have these offers up here but we didn't really see that much on the offers to the upside but as the day progressed you saw Bitcoin made a move up and then it came straight back down so what they did was they effectively gone for the liquidity took the money and then they brought bitcoin's price all the way down again now Bitcoin is set at the point of control so that is really important because this is where most of the contracts are being exchanged in terms of buying and selling we just have a look you can see that the point of control sits at 7195 where we go yeah it's it's 719 on the bid side 568 on the offer side there's not really that many aggressive players coming into this but we are at the 66,500 Zone the 25-day profile itself shows you that we got lots of liquidity up here but it's the bids down here man look we got some big bids coming into play 250 contracts Bitcoin 350 contracts quickly going into the offers and you can see that we've got some offers down here 1.5 million 8 million 65721 so in other words if they were to break the 66,000 they would go and get that liquidity there it is that's 66k Zone we got 12, 350,000 right there on a bid order which could trigger quite a bit of an interest because we're not really seeing the offers coming into play you can see there's no one really looking to sell Bitcoin you got some dudes up here selling at 70,000 but that order's been in there for absolutely ages so and I'm not I'm not seeing anyone selling Bitcoin inside of this range right here that's not really what we want to be looking at well we don't want to be seeing that we want to see PE see people buying the Bitcoin and the only way they're going to be buying it is if people are selling it and we're seeing a reduction in the amount of offers being against the book on the bid side so you can see here that doesn't show that much of a darker color compared to or lighter color compared to the green which tells me I've got more guys committed to buying Bitcoin as it drops as opposed to selling the Bitcoin when it rises okay and that's something that you really want to get aligned with going over into the liquidations itself let's have a look at the Bitcoin liquidations do we have any of those charts right there where are you there we go so 3,247 Traders have been liquidated in the last hour so that's not very very good having a look I'm refreshing this stuff right here so yeah Longs are being liquidated quite aggressively at that yeah Longs are being had 28 million on Longs on ethereum and 15 million on bitcoin yeah so Longs are being had right now but when we go back into this chart what I like to do is go to the one hour time frame and have a look at the relationship between how many guys are being liquidated and for how long open interest is coming down but that could be guys covering um closing positions yeah you can see down here look symbol liquidations you don't really see that many aggressive liquidations coming in other than the fact that we had this massive liquidation of five nearly six million Longs getting liquidated on this Candlestick right here but I'm not really seeing short liquidations which means that we could be going into another wave of long liquidations which could suggest bitcoin's move to get ready to come to the down downside you might see a little bit of a recovery back up on bitcoin but it all depends on how Tesla's going to be performing today we got a red Vector candle right there on the hourly stop and volume candle which could be a bit of a problem for me with the wick so I got to be paying attention to that going over to the euro she's making a little bit of a bounce that's fine going over into gold quickly have a look at gold gold is just taking a shoe bag to the downside which is nice because we were expecting that move to the downside but we are coming into some very interesting points look the red Vector candles are loading up on gold so there could be opportunities to then Mark on gold again so they're leaving Clues behind for what they could be doing later on NASDAQ not really doing anything it's just trading sideways 5 minute time Fram looks like it's going to keep on rolling lower we got Vector candle recovery points right here I'd expect them to keep on doing this move to the downside coming close to the Tesla earnings then we'll be able to know if they're going to be favoring higher prices on the news announcements of that quickly going over into Nvidia where's Nvidia here we go Nvidia oo gap down on the old Nvidia so we're going to see some big buying on Nvidia coming into play soon got to be very careful with Nvidia I wouldn't be trading NASDAQ or Nvidia not until later on in the day this Gap right here is very important but Tesla's going to be leading the markets in that principle what we got here Tesla's trading very well actually so they're closing off the Gap right here so that could be an inim that they could be selling the Tesla stock and then the news comes out it might not be good news for Tesla it all depends on what they have in store for it just quickly going over to stocks on the options Market as well let's just quickly have a look at what's going on over there in terms of options right now we've got an Nvidia call well Nvidia sell calls coming into play not really that big but I've seen STM byy puts so we've got 300,000 on there nothing really grabbing my attention yet I got Nvidia buy calls over here so that's nothing there sort of massive order on KO sell post earnings post earnings on sale so what is KO let's have a look what is going on there cocacola oh so Coca-Cola hasn't done too well yes at the open Coca-Cola didn't do too well then okay then that makes sense so they think it's going to be coming down fine but I'm looking for NVIDIA I'm not really seeing no big purchases sell puts on GE so GE did they do well yesterday let's have a look I think they did do well GE Aerospace they've gapped up but they gap down okay so there could be some buy orders coming in they'll fill those gaps right there so there's not really a problem in regards to that anyways not really seeing any orders for Bitcoin QQQ is not coming into place it looks like it's pretty quiet here we go nothing nothing much I'm not really seeing anything so today could be a quiet day which might not encourage me so got some sell orders on Mara Mara stock but yeah I'm not really seeing anything in terms of the options flow ladies and gentlemen it's not really grabbing my attention not really grabbing my attention uh yes the beige book is coming out today that's interesting anyways Bitcoin making a nice little bit of a movement up that's good news for us and look any moves up ladies and gentlemen okay if you're capitalizing on that do something about it take profit all right just be careful this Vector candle down here they've been going lower lows and volume's been rising on the Move lower so that's a bit of a problem thereo do you use the desktop web desktop pro version or web premium version of EXO charts can you share settings for EXO charts and coin Ang um I use desktop version always desktop version can be a bit laggy at times but it's the best thing for me on the desktop version and coin an settings it's it's just factory settings bro I just change the colors about and just add indicators actually got them actually on I've got liquidation heat map that's that there liquid profile that's there don't even need that to be fair and liquidation levels these are all liquidation points so yeah nothing really fancy just all it's all factory settings bro it literally is all factory settings um man you got some special questions man are you guys reading these questions related to trading snow leopards live in the snow and grasshoppers live in the grass where do cockroaches live my day bro I can see now gold and silver going down with red vectors aggressively does this mean that they are buying a lot of it again for a reversal to the upside correct that's exactly what it is which Dom do you use for trading I use um jigsaw use jigsaw CA do you like mushed Oh my days does he like peas Oh my days anyways Bitcoin making a nice little bit of a move just be mindful are you guys participating in this two ethereum giveaway to the end of the month it's going to be done all right 0. five giveaway guaranteed to platinum members that doesn't mean you get 0.5 guaranteed to you when you become a platinum member that's where you get the trade setups and what have you you get way more than just the trade setups but you get discount 20% Which is pined at the top of the chat and then we're going to give away 1.5 ethereum split the three people in the Traders reality community and that's courtesy of btcc as well so that's with these guys and get a discount when you join them um the bonus sorry and then of course you get the VPN story in the kyc you don't need it if you're in the United States but the ideal thing is that you can trade NASDAQ and the S&P gold and silver and crypto all at the same time when you're using btcc okay so that's going to be something that you can take advantage of in terms of hedging yourself you can hedge yourself when you are trading those assets especially with stocks as well we've got Tesla earnings coming out you can trade Tesla where's Tesla there you you go Tesla coming up there you can effectively prepare yourself for it looks like Tesla's getting a bit choppy so that could lead the day to being a bit choppy so just be very careful all right everything you need is in the description of the live stream ladies and gentlemen oh Bitcoin what are you doing Bitcoin making a nice little move does that mean no be careful gang be very careful Bitcoin pumping like that is too much way too much there's no reason for it to be pumping unless they're going for the offers they they must be going for the offers be careful of this green Vector candle do you think we'll have an altcoin season um I don't how would you play Bitcoin with Tesla earnings does B start cover out of hours no it doesn't but it does allow you to trade Bitcoin all right listen how are you going to play Bitcoin and Tesla well when Tesla declares its earnings it's going to be towards the end of the day NASDAQ and S&P markets will still be open because they close at 10 p.m. UK time which is 5 PM East standard right so there'll still be that window now if Tesla does do well the out of hours Market on NASDAQ and S&P when they open after 11: so an hour later there's going to be volatility and that's going to tell us if it's good news and then the markets in principle should be breaking out okay so it's all going to be on Tesla today I think the NASDAQ and the S&P are going to be ranging out I really think they're going to range out today in preparation for it it's going to be very tricky to trade the NASDAQ and the S&P and with that being said let me just actually have a look at this hold on a second man I need a drink I need to drink a coffee look I'm I'm just not liking this at all you know what I was going to open some options today yeah the point of control is down here which means it's been changed but NASDAQ could mark up a little bit but I just don't I don't like the idea of what I'm going into if I took trades today just looking at the range of the NASDAQ it just looks like a pain in the backside what time we on it's 10 to okay yeah we got Vector candles to the left of the chart that'll be ideal they're coming back into the vector zones over here but because NASDAQ is just staying sideways with no real conviction of the move I'm very reluctant to trade NASDAQ today might just wait and see once we get a bold move in the market once get a bold move away from moving averages or vaps and what have you and we've seen an absorption of bids and offers and I'll start trading NASDAQ and S&P but I don't need to even do that yet I'm going wait and see anyways um order here we go how is the order flow on Nvidia could we get a green Vector CLE recovery on 375 maybe load up from there for shortterm long term um look what you got to watch out for with Nvidia guys is because I'm I watch Nvidia all the time when I'm trading Nasdaq all the time logic would say that they're going to close this Gap off okay selling off there well they're just loading up in my opinion okay but what you got to be mindful of is that ve that Vector candle over here three hits to the high in principle it does lead it to go lower but today we will know if Tesla is going to lead any more flavor to the upside for the NASDAQ and IBM as well looking at how other assets are performing you could you can you can really appreciate that everything is overvalued this looks like a blowoff move to the upside but meta see they're pulling all back it's all coming back but I do believe we're going to get reversals coming into play oil making a move up naturally when oil goes up the stock market goes down and dollar dominance itself pulling back a little bit has been going up all morning the appreciation on the dollar is huge right now so that's going to really lead us to understand why maybe Bitcoin is going up but just be very careful with Bitcoin okay Bank of Canada cuts his interest rate to 50 basis points okay so then that means USD CAD is yeah quite a bit of an aggressive move up so we really need to see that going down again okay then cool go to Japanese Yen let's have a look at Japanese Yen going down yeah baby carry trade principle is working nicely bonds Market where we at 10year bonds going down yields going yields are going up not good the yields are going up that's no good we don't want the yields to go up because it's going to be tough on the stock market when yields are up stock market doesn't really do too well okay anyways ladies and gentlemen I'm not feeling too good right now I don't know why but with that being said if you've learned something Happy Days welcome to the truth and the real realityy of the way this game operates if you don't like it never mind come back tomorrow and maybe it'll be good news but there will always be something to be complaining about that's just life anyways hit the like button that'll be sad if you don't do that mad love and respect peace\", 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'ai_explanation': \"In the transcript, Tino discusses the complexity and potential volatility of the current stock market, Bitcoin, and other

      "{'id': 4, 'datetime': '2024-10-24 14:53:28.404083', 'video_id': 'NlLK_eTP-8I', 'transcript': \"welcome ladies and gentlemen yes new day so what's been going on well we've had some news unemployment claims coming lower again what is going on still got some more data coming out at quarter to 3 which will be in around 46 well about 40 minutes or so which is going to tell us about the is about the manufacturing data flash manufacturing data for the US economy itself now this data that's come out regarding the unemployment data is really important because it does tell us how how much strength does the labor market have and how's that going to look for the cuts in the interest rates now you might be hearing a lot about what's going on with the economy if you see that um Nvidia is nearly 10% of what the market cap is of the US debt okay so $3.5 trillion $ 35 trillion Market sorry um debt on the US the last time that happened was with Cisco but they were around 16% of the market cap and what happened after that well we had a little bit of a crash do we think we're going to go into a crash well look it's not a case of do I think we're going to have one we are going to have one it's just a case of when and what we're trying to work out is what's it going to do to bitcoin which is going to lead me to today's topic on how the election is going to impact crypto currenc currency so we're going to be talking about that we're also going to dive into what's going on in the marketplace in the sense of the treasury market because there's lots of activity happening on that and then we're also going to dive into a little bit of Forex because we need to understand with the Yen going down so aggressively will there be time for them to intervene again because they can't have the dollar going up so aggressively it doesn't serve them it does serve them and it doesn't because the problem that we've got is Japan is the largest holder of us bonds but the bonds are taking a nose dive so they could technically sell their bonds and generate more of a return based on the purchasing power of the dollar and will they then use that dollar to put it into buying the yen to inflate the Yen again wow Tino that's really confusing well welcome to trading ladies and gentlemen because that's what it's all about is understanding the flow of liquidity across several asset classes hopefully you guys in crypto will come to understand it but as long as you've got a clear look on what the yields are doing the treasuries are doing because when it comes to interest rates those are the two asset classes we really need to understand which is going to effectively tell us whether or not investors are going to go into the stock market or they're going to retain themselves and sit in cash so by the time we're done with this live you should have a good understanding about all of that with that being said mad love and respect to everyone yes I know the tax by Italy now Denmark is doing the same thing by 2025 they're going to put a tax on unrealized tax on cryptocurrency it's like all of the Euro zones trying to do all of this yet you've got the election where it's Pro crypto with Trump and then a little bit of pro crypto with Harris it's like they're for crypto but then when we do get the guys into Power what's going to happen after that which is what we're going to be talking about in today's live stream so let's get with the program let's get with the flavor mad love and respect to everyone passing through let's have a conversation I ain't trade I actually tell a lie I am I am in a little bit of a trade yes I am I'm trading some options here we go so got some two-day options on the S&P I'm trading the the expiry is in one day's time and so far we got around $750 worth of profit we had a peak of around $ 12250 today and I'm just going to let this one ride out on the assumption that the S&P and the NASDAQ are going to make some significant movement going in today only because Tesla has had a pretty decent run Tesla right now is currently gapped up look at this Gap unbelievable $244 in the pre-market okay so there's a lot of flavor with Tesla they've completely filled the Gap right there and that's going to give us sentiment that the market could be on for a good one today going into that with Nvidia she too is also gapped up and is bouncing around the 144 140 region with the potential for them to close the gap that they've got over here at the 143 I won't be looking at the charts today as much because I just need to take a break from Trading but nonetheless I'll be ready for it back on Monday but looking at the way things are operating we could have have ourselves a continuation day on the Nvidia to start marking up again because people managed to get it on a discount the earnings season itself isn't over just yet because we do have earnings results coming out for other companies don't have anything that we really need to be concerned about going in today but Friday we don't even have anything to be concerned about at all but the going into next week when we start hearing about Google and and Amazon and what have you let's just go into the 20 let's go to the 29th here you go Google alphabet right there and we got visa and AMD they're going to be declaring their earnings McDonald's is going to be declaring their earnings and HSBC and then going into Wednesday you got Microsoft you got meta so all of The Magnificent Seven are pretty much declaring their earnings which is going to be an interesting time for us next week um 31st of October you got Amazon and apple back to back sharing their earnings at the close of the market so it's going to be a mad one going into the close of October which is why I said that coming into the new coming into the new month I'm expecting some big volatility to come into play with cryptocurrency ladies and gentlemen okay now going into it all what's the story about today well look let's just break down what's going on in crypto to understand that logic and then we can make sense of what is going to happen around the stock market well actually let's just flip it before we do crypto understand this they're climbing on earnings optimism and the treasu is gain so straight off the back we know that the treasury markets Are Climbing so we go over to the treasury markets and this is what you want to do when you're getting ready to trade have a look at what the sentiment has been in the Asian session so the 10-year B bonds Market what do you see you don't really see much happening they are marking up they have marked up and they are trading positive for the day but if everyone believes that the US economy is going to go to the pan and what have you they are naturally going to be shorting the bond market but more importantly they're going to be going over into the dollar but what youve got to understand is this dollar right now gives you 3.8% appreciation on purchases that means you're going to be getting more of something that you purchase in dollars at the same time you can now get more Euros off the back of a strong dollar now certain head Traders are effectively going to be protecting themselves and they might be bu buying some Euros which would effectively end up coming down with the dollar itself we've also got the idea of the Japanese Yen which could get involved in intervention stories and we can see here that we are heading in towards those regions of the intervention if we just go over to this chart right here and just type in intervention Japan we just type that in and we can see that these are the sorry oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no let's go back go back go back go back into it here we go Forex intervention so this is when the bank of Japan injects cash into the markets and this is what we've had so far so going into 2022 we had one cash injection which effectively led the dollar to come down we had another one which pulled the dollar back down again and then we had a final one over here which led the dollar to come down even more the logic says that if we do get an intervention of from the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Japanese again that would mean that the dollar is going to come down fundamentally the assets against the US dollar will be going up okay but the issue that I've got with the Japanese yen is as follows even if they do intervene the prospect of them increasing the interest rate could be something that they do which effectively means that at the highs of this range right here the carry trade principle was engaged and there was still $4 trillion left in the carry okay now the carry trade principle is pretty simple it effectively means that you take your Japanese Yen all right you borrow that Japanese Yen then take it sell it and convert it to Dollars take those dollars and then put those to work and go invest in the stock market which is why you're seeing the Japanese Yen going down and the stock market going up okay for the other guys who trade carry principles you can look at Aussie dollar sorry Aussie ym okay so you can go and exchange the the dollar itself and exchange it over to Australian dollar and then use those Aussie dollars to go and buy stock so when Aussie yen is going up you'll always see the NASDAQ going up as well okay same thing happens with the Japanese Yen as well but if the Japanese decide to inter and then they throw a double whammy and smack the interest rates up that's going to force the guys who were at this point right here loading up into the $4 trillion carry well I'd assume that there could be another trillion dollars into that so let's make the assumption that it's around5 trillion now they increase their interest rate again then we're going to have ourselves another problem where the dollar is going to go and collapse not collapse but it's going to drop down aggressively but the bonds will go up because that's what happened go back on the 5th of August go to the bonds Market okay okay and look what happened on the 5th of August where were we this was the result of them increasing the Yen 5th of August massive pump in the bonds okay and this was the buildup towards it as well because they actually increased the interest rates on the 31st of July they put that out there increasing the interest rates bang and then what happens they're just climbing up climbing up climbing up and then you had that mad move to the downside everyone went into the bonds and then they sold those bonds because they were able to get a good price on those bonds and then it just slumped back down again okay so that's what I mean about the volatility of the bonds market and understanding this is going to help you understand what Bitcoin is likely to do so bonds they seem to be trading negatively the yields they're trading at Highs but they have just coming away from the 4% Mark 4.6 well what was the high yesterday high was 4.08% we really need the 2-year yield to come down to 3.9 that's what we need we need that to come down but the problem is they're not going into the bonds they're going into cash or they're going into gold and that's where the problem is not enough people are going into Bitcoin per say which leads me over to this story right here how will the presidential election influence bitcoin price you've got a number of things that are going to come into play the actual article says that there's only one in five people under the age of 42 that hold digital assets all right what does that tell you tells you that there's not enough Mom and Dad investors who've got all their money locked up in IR in in the IRS and in in all sorts of financial products that they use to protect their pensions generate an income savings accounts you name it okay ETFs is a massive and popular thing in the US especially for the older gang right when that older lock decide to say yeah you know what let's get involved in Bitcoin that's when you're naturally going to see Bitcoin making a move to the upside all right other things that can affect cryptocurrency the election itself whether Trump is pro crypto or not because quite frankly he's Pro dollar all right all these policies that going to put out someone's listening to me I'm not allowed to talk about Trump excuse me all these policies that he's putting out are favoring the US dollar that doesn't help Bitcoin so the only reason the election would help crypto is if anyone that sees that someone who's trying to step into the office is pro crypto he's going to get their vote because given that a lot of people in crypto are younger they're going to be more impressionable to believe that he's going to serve cryptocurrency okay well we don't know what policies are going to come into play that leads me into regulation as well look what's going on Denmark increasing taxes on crypto Italy increasing taxes what do you think the us is going to do they're going to do exactly the same thing it'll be worse with Harris and it might be a little have some leniency with Trump if he were to win okay so those are things that can actually impact cryptocurrency but more importantly at the end of the day whether it's an election or not to rely on the election alone to justify bitcoin's movement to the upside is not enough in my opinion okay it's if we didn't have an election we'd all be waiting for certain structural patterns to come into play all right so when I look at the election I say to myself okay what can that do for Bitcoin well is the election going to dict take whether or not Bitcoin can break out of a trend line because fundamentally it's broken out of a trend line okay and that's what we've got right here so traders that use indicators will be relying on that okay you get Traders like this saying Trader foresees Bitcoin rally as a crucial indicator signals uptrend that's in the macds okay so the macd are coming in saying yep that's it man get ready for some movement to the upside all right that's cool the problem that I've got is even though the election itself is going to bring volatility naturally because we're waiting for an event we're waiting to see who's going to win we will see initially in my opinion I do believe Bitcoin is going to break the all-time high by the time the election comes into play and it might happen once we know the result of the election and once that does come into action then we see Bitcoin make the alltime high that's going to grab a lot of interest in people bitcoin's broken out and what have you and then Bitcoin is going to go back into its routine and then pull back again okay it's what happens once the election is done because after that we take our attention back to the interest rates and going by the data that we receiv received today 227 on the unemployment claims it looks like we've got ourselves a robust economy all right and remember the US can't default on its debt but the big key indicator is how the bonds markets are going to be moving so please when you are taking trades watch what the yields do as the election comes you're going to know for sure if the market likes who they've got in power when you look at the way the bonds and the yields Market operate if the yields shoot up okay and the stock market goes even higher investors are happy and they want to take on risk okay if the yield shoot up and the bonds barely move but the NASDAQ and the stock market start to pull back investors are going into Cash positions because they don't want risk they don't even want low risk because then that would say that they're not really looking like they favor the longer term that's why the yields moving up hurts tech stocks because they rely on yields okay and if yields are too expensive in terms of interest rates that's going to be affecting these companies because they borrow money to do their business could you imagine we're going into earning season and now we know that we're still at 5% and then we go to the next FC meeting in November and they say yeah going to hold the interest rates the companies that have been borrowing money from the previous FMC meeting till now they're going to effectively have a restructuring on things and be like right what money can we borrow can we put anything to work what's our rate it's still the same as what it was before okay we can absorb that increase the cost of our Goods on X Y and Zed and then naturally that's going to end up leading to inflation going up especially with Trump wanting to cut the taxes as well which the consumer will naturally be paying for so it's a really it's a really tricky situation and we won't know exactly where we stand until the market actually absorbs the decision that is made on who is going to be the president where where's where's your where where are your heads at ladies and gentlemen you know that that's the question where are your heads at you know you know what when I read people's comments about fud that's the that's ignorance right there you don't want to listen you ain't getting hopium here my bro you're getting facts you get we're talking money here we're in the flow of money if you want hopium go and ask chat GPT to tell you a good story about Bitcoin get out of my live bro if you don't want facts get out of my live my days winds me up it really does dead comments dead comments I don't get it anyways what are the yield tickets to use us2y us10 y us3 y yes fact four years still in play until it isn't there's been plenty of this time is different every cycle guess what happens it's the same of course it is Dylan that's exactly the same story it's always going to be the same thing cor expansion contraction and then when you come back to me and then say to me look I said this before when Bitcoin decides to do the opposite of what the marketplace is doing you've got a culture change in Bitcoin right now it ain't doing that it is not doing that just go and have a look at where we are with the marketplace right now so here we go S&P holding out NASDAQ holding out not really doing anything markets open in the next 10 minutes okay so Tesla liquidity is coming in it's going up so that only tells me that the Market's going to be pumping gold what's gold doing going back up red Vector candle you've been hearing me saying it all week when you see red Vector candles on gold and they are in the accumulation phase red Vector candles come into play they will then recover them because they are bidding gold on the downside to effectively offer it out because they're buying more at the highest possible Point within the lowest range and there you got the recovery of that go back and look at the red Vector candles that appear on gold during this alltime High move red Vector candle they come back into it red Vector back into it red Vector back into it big red Vector can't break the moving averages up she goes big red Vector candle stopping volume candle intervention up she goes not intervention but I'm saying Market maker stepping in because of course they would have been in a negative gamma situation there and they need to protect themselves so they need to mark it all back up again but that's another story about options trading but anyways I'm not going to get into that because that will blow your minds um my wife's boyfriend said I should sell my crypto and buy chickens you know what your wife's boyfriend is funny bro Tino if you were serious question if you were serious about what serious about would you recommend EXO charts or bookm what's the best for scalping using hybrid system in my opinion I think EXO charts is much more smoother okay it's much more smoother to use it's it gives you more options and a lot of flexibility with EXO charts and you can really see the vectors inside of EXO charts the book map is really for you've got to really study the book map you've got to get with the flow on the book map okay I I watched that thing 48 hours straight I don't use it as much anymore because I just don't use it I'm getting more data off EXO charts but I'm using the depth of Market more now just for execution like that okay how will Tech earnings Federal impact and federal and federal will impact NASDAQ Tino um how will the tech earnings the tech earnings will impact NASDAQ massively it will impact the NASDAQ massive L listen if Google and Amazon don't do well okay that's just going to be it's they listen the the the thing about the earnings is this the bar for the earnings was around 4.2% is what they're expecting on average okay companies have been smashing that so in other words they've set the expectations really low but they've been coming in really high so you're like okay things are really well that's why NASDAQ will take its alltime high it will take its alltime high before the election and if it doesn't then you you know for sure that something's not right cuz the S&P has just been going it has been going Nvidia has been hitting alltime highs which means that if NASDAQ doesn't take its all-time high it means that only Nvidia has really been holding the NASDAQ up but there's not enough conviction from other stocks there's not enough money going into it to suggest an overall move because as much as we assume that the leader is going to then present everyone else's everyone's going to follow suit if the bigger Market is not moving and you've only got one asset that's just moving eventually that asset is also going to come down because it's just going to be overwhelming Nvidia can't hold all of the stock market but with $3.5 trillion market cap blood L is doing good what does it look like on the depth of Market when they refuse to tap a Zone tap above a Zone in an accumulation area before breaking down sometimes what you'll find on the depth of Market there will be an influx of offers okay which will be buying and what you're looking for at specific zones is if there are people trapped so when you see Bitcoin taking an area for example you see Bitcoin taking this high right here yeah if it takes this high but then stays at this point and you see lots of orders coming in on the depth of Market that's consistent with Traders getting trapped because all these people are coming in and buying and buying and buying and the sellers are effectively containing price and holding it so that's consistent with absorption and they are selling into all those guy they're buying from all those guys but keeping price at the highs all these Traders are trading up there and that's where the Longs are trapped you're looking at the Delta and it's showing you positive that means byy bye byy but price isn't going then what happens the next candle comes in and they're overwhelmed with all these buyers bang she drops back down so that's how it works if Bitcoin claim the psychological high in the 1 hour time frame does this mean it's going to pump towards at least its local pick um listen if Bitcoin can claim the psychological ranges and given that it is Thursday today that is a very very good move in BTC a very good move if it can get above the psychological ranges because we are heading towards what appears to be the Asian session range I said this week that this could be the high of the week so if Bitcoin can follow through today and give us a good flavorsome move and Bitcoin can get away from the Asian session going into the weekend Bitcoin is going to fly that would be the logic Tino why does NASDAQ always make a move towards the end of the New York session you mentioned it to level up order to level up order book but what does that mean so it's a power out in essence It's the final hour before the market closes and the the markets effectively have to level the boook so there's going to be an influx of orders where they can just throw anything they want and that's when the ticker goes a little bit crazy I don't recommend you trade that sort of time but the reason they do it is just to get the book aligned and prepared for the next session there are orders that are going to be placed and there's orders going to be placed out of the market and then that 1 hour time difference that they have where there's no trading that's the book being leveled in the out of hours market so setting the spread as such okay um salana is just a beast salana is killing it for me I'm actually I enjoying salana he doing really well just having a look at just having a look at the options market right now the market isn't open just yet got two more minutes until that happens i' got some spy put uh some buy puts coming in on the S&P okay not really seeing anything in terms of yeah we got some spy calls okay we got nearly a million on the bit on NASDAQ okay so that's Deon no that was yesterday just before the close okay not really seeing anything just yet nasda coming back down a standard yeah I'm expecting them to do that but the market isn't open just yet so yeah my plan for today ladies and gentlemen my plan is just to not do anything I'm really not going to do anything I'm really not I've done my Trading I'm I'm I'm shattered that when you're trading every day you can it does take its toll on you it really does especially with the way I trade I'm looking for small moves and having to make the same decision over and over again scalping scalp out scalping scalp out sometimes I like to hold on to a scalp try and get about 105 ticks on the S&P maybe get 150 ticks on the NASDAQ and then you get into that consolidation with the NASDAQ something it just goes up and down up and down up and down it can be a bit frustrating I stand 24/7 I don't sit down when I'm trading I'm always standing up and and you know it's you just fixated on the charts and that's how you get the information Tino what how's your favorite stable coin since the recent rep pegging we were not allowed to use profanities in this live stream so please sorry I can't answer that question you know please don't mention that stupid asset other questions what we got when do you think we see the high on bit on bitcoin this run um see this is what I mean man no one knows what price Bitcoin is going to go but all you do know okay what you do know is this when you're focusing on what the bonds markets are doing that's going to tell you what investors heads are thinking so right now we've got the bonds going down right now we've got the yields going up okay right now we got the NASDAQ pulling back we've got the S&P pulling back what else have we got we got the dollar dominance pulling back what's oil doing sort of climbing up Tesla up 14% for the open Crazy Nvidia already up 1% crazy so what's the market doing oh the market is preparing the market get ready for the Stop run get ready for the Brinks box creation wait for that Brinks to complete and then you've got got your money trade that's all you got to do you got to wait for this box to complete I'm going to update the Platinum members after the live I want to get the update done just before 300 p.m. which gives them half an hour in principle to prepare for the Brinks now the Brinks in essence is going to tell us exactly what we can expect going into the day so what we got here nasdaq's coming back down to this green Vector candle they haven't tested the daily open but only broken it once the logic is that we'd expect them to test the daily open and pull some very interesting Behavior the Market itself is in what would appear to be good news okay because Tesla's doing well well we only know if that's the proof If Tesla doesn't close this Gap okay and it trades away from this range and continues all right at the same time Bitcoin it's doing okay it isn't bad but it's doing all right it's a slow climb but the Brinks itself needs to solidify itself there's a problem with this range because they've swept it that's the issue we've got there's not been a follow through so we really need to see B Bitcoin pulling numbers from this point if it doesn't then bitcoin's probably going to go down and they can form the Brinks so we got 30 minutes for the Brinks to form which is effectively the opening range of the market when it's open all right so the first 30 minutes how does it's the first hour how does it form so all of you go and take go and take the 1 p.m. no sorry 2 p.m. and mark off the 3:00 time itself that's one zone that all you need to do is look at okay I've done a checklist on it for the Platinum members on the Brinks Spock strategy and everything in detail about how I use the Brinks to determine what price is going to do okay you get that if you become a platinum member and you get a discount on that as well 20% if you do it for the first month okay now you effectively set a high you set the low and then you work on that but remember you've still got 30 minutes so this high and this low can change the high the low could come all the way down here and then we have ourselves a wide Brinks box the high could be all the way up here so then you got an even wider Brinks box itself that's why I say wait until the market close sorry when the market finalizes at 300 p.m. which not when I say finalize it means once the Market's fully open and 300 p.m. hits which is 10: a.m. eastern standard and then you'll effectively have yourself a range that you can work with and the the the key aspect to trading the Brinks box is this the less time they spend trying to work towards one zone of the Brinks box the greater chance that there's going to be a chance they're going to work away from it okay so another words if you see price holding for example look at this you see price holding this range right here but it's not breaking up it's not breaking up you're inclined to believe that if they're not going up towards that zone there's a possibility that they could come back down and then it does come back down hindsight happy days but you can justify it with the vector candles because you'd be having that logic when you're looking at Price forming that structure if they really meant business about holding price in this point they would move away from it but they spend all that time trying to work around it and then what do they do they come back into the vector you take a short on that principle because you're not seeing them do doing more of what you don't think they're going to do if you don't think they're going to go higher that means they're preparing for something else and that's what you've got to work with guys this is the market there's no one going to tell you where it's indefinitely going to go it's all about dealing with information that you're getting now it's reacting to the now all right so when someone says what do you think bitcoin's price is going to be in the next ball run like bro like you're asking me what the weather is going to be like in two years time no one knows you know got some flavor coming in right now of Bitcoin let me just what are you doing come on there we go okay any other questions that's 3:00 British time UK time 3 p.m. which is in 30 minutes time 25 minutes time Tino yesterday someone asked where would ethereum be by the end of the year and you said that's impossible listen nothing's impossible if you just get enough people that are going to be buying and selling then fine right now I'm looking at the Spy SPX just looking at the way it's behaving SPX let's quickly go over to the SPX have a look at that so it's gapped up I've got some interest around 5867 on the SPX that's where cuz right now we're in pretty much Even's territory in terms of options in terms of the gamma per se we're not really heading into a positive Gamma or negative gamma region and the reason I'm talking about that is because market makers use gamma all right they are relying on Delta edging that's what they do and I'm just looking at it right now and not going to see anything until they really do something as we get towards the 5867 Zone could that would effectively put us towards the range daily High where we would naturally be expecting them to try and retrace and close off the Gap right here on SPX that's what we would be looking for in that sense but we need to wait and see if the flavor is going to come in on that basis okay Justin Hill how you doing bro pretty new mad love to you bro anyone that's new to the channel be sure to like And subscribe if you are new and you've been watching the madness I forgive me Tina what do you do to deal with a loss any tips go watch last night's live stream I'll tell you what go and watch the last live streams over the last couple of weeks and then go watch last night's live stream where we took a nice little smack Rune of 25 racks across our face and that's how you deal with it you take the loss why does your nose run and your feet smell [\\xa0__\\xa0] man I don't know man you guys you guys are something here we go Japanese Finance Minister issued a warning against currency speculation on Wednesday expressing concern over one-sided rapid moves in the currency Market that have been D driving down the Yen's value that sir is intervention they're going to get ready and step in and pump something um how's Russell not it's doing all right to be fair anyways ladies and gentlemen but Bitcoin going up dur during the US Brinks is that a bad sign no it probably isn't a good sign it probably is a bad sign but listen when you're dealing with Bitcoin making a move up in the US Brinks okay this is the first hour that's why I'm stalling it this is the first hour of trading just focus on what they do mark off the high mark off the low once the hour is done that means 3 p.m. in 25 minutes time then trade around that logic if you see them going out to break above the high trade it if you see him breaking down the low trade it you're trading reactions right now what you're saying to me is Bitcoin going to go up or down and that's the information that I'm working with that's what I'm working with because as much as I'm looking at what it's doing now what I'm really doing is trying to assume what it's going to do over here and that's what the realm of uncertainty is and when you're all right with that because our brains are wired to seek certainty they're not wired to handle uncertainty that's why some Traders aren't cut for the game because they need guarantees that's why people want they want to know Bitcoin up or down they'll never get it Bitcoin will move up Bitcoin will move down I'll give you both scenarios I'll say bitcoin's going to go up you'll say no it's going to go down Bitcoin goes down you're right Bitcoin moves up I'm right who loses no one it's one of those um oh God you guys are you guys are funny you talk Tina you haven't talked about the one thing we can't name I'm sad be sad stay sad I'll be sad with you my bro I ain't talking about it I'm not talking about xrp forget it it's done it's a Dustbin coin you know if a recycling center was to create a coin it would be called xrp that's what it would be called a Dustbin coin Tino green Vector candles going nowhere potentially on the Brinks can't tell you because the Brinks ain't complete you don't know that yet this could be a probe this could be a preparation what side of liquidity is close what do we see well where's the big money at what did they do last time at the olical range they sold from it so what do you want to do see price doing you want to see price going there if they're going to sell from it again Gap fill Master nah never mind be a man imagine if they pump it though if they pump it they pump it man look at nasdaq's situation what's wrong with Nasdaq nasdaq's all right it's always going to do this little stop run drop to the downside and make a reversal it always does it this is what NASDAQ does makes everybody wet the bed and then they come back into it problem is you got Vector candles right here so that's a bit of an issue for me S&P the same story right there SPX seems to be holding out all right so I'm not too concerned about that to be fair guys right are we liking the stream ladies and gentlemen no we're not that's sad um any other questions other than that Gap filling talk about xrp do you take the same approach with the EU brings IE breakout retest yes Peter I do PMI 5 minutes I'm going to stay for the PMI guys in 5 minutes I'm going to stay for the PMI reading which is in 5 minutes time here we go we're going to wait for this data cuz that's going to be a market mover in principle let's make the assumption that they' moved NASDAQ down to effectively come back up so that's going to be something I'm interested in very very shortly Tina do you think the EMA daily is good yet so the 13 EMA on The Daily time frame for Bitcoin this is ideally for holders I'm going to give you this guys okay the holders what you've got to do is use the 5 and 13 EMA if today's price action closes above the five and the 13 EMA that's a good sign for Bitcoin okay so if it can sustain itself above the 5 and 13 EMA and stay positive above the 5 and 13 EMA which is the yellow line the 5 EMA 13 EMA is the red line if it can stay above that then this is good for a rally up okay over the next few days that's what we're looking at here as long as today's Candlestick can sustain it all right that's what really needs to happen lots of liquid liquidations are coming into play lots of offers are coming into play past hour 741 Traders were liquidated some big margins up there on the short 70,000 man that Bitcoin doesn't claim it then that's it what is exactly the Brinks box who's trade who is trading during it everyone's trading during the Brinks box it's the it's the first hour where the market comes into play everyone's absorbing the news announcements on Tesla everyone's absorbing the news on Nvidia like everyone's putting money to work and Tesla's already up like 16% already okay okay NASDAQ and Nvidia still holding out but n you know Tesla's leading the marketplace today right meta seems to be doing well coming away from its lows Amazon coming up again so Visa's coming up as well got a gap down but they're going to want to try and close that Gap as well gold doing its flavor ladies and gentlemen and Bitcoin in principle should be following suit There She Goes man it's breaking up man as long as it stays above the 5 and3 EMA you are good today ladies and gentlemen to hold Longs or spot traders to hold on okay T you yeah yeah go on to exchanges that have the most volume so in this instance it's going to be binance all right that's where you can trust the vectors here we go green Vector candle on BTC coming into play um h H why do bitcoiners want a Lambo because Ferrari's own by fear nice very nice I like I like that one it's not that I don't like it I just don't use it I'm just getting information elsewhere Finance futures bance Futures use binance Futures okay any other questions Rumor Has It Black Rock brought 5,000 Etc okay if there are more live in the universe what do you think the chances is now could it reach 68k and fall back down to 64 why do we need to see it go down it could go to 68 and go here we go come on man I want the data come hurry up flash PMI what are they doing are they going into bonds what's the yields doing wait there yields ain't doing anything bonds and down S&P having the day off NASDAQ trying to come back up the ultra bonds treasuries some decent volatility on the treasures to be fair Yen holding oil coming up Euro nice sweep to the upside Platinum members I hope you're taking some profits on Euro man getting tricky Bitcoin psychological range Happy Days um drone P was awarded a Nobel Prize for chemistry for turning the US [Laughter] doll I like that one I like that camelto oh bro for God's sake man I'm just reading anything I don't care um what else you got for me Tino an old one but what happened to the twins don't talk about twis I listen I don't I don't want no xrp no it's fine I don't need any xrp it's okay you know I I kindly return the gesture to you my friend it's fine you just you keep your xrp is fine no thank you do you think there will be a short downfall for crypto before the election then the move up probably just here we go data oh for God's sake it's funny isn't it getting close to the election and then that have nothing really much has coming Euro's not really doing much gold ain't doing much probably going to be one of those dead days again looks like it's crypto's day to be honest with you so now with that being said ladies and gentlemen back to ATK lost of money 10K to 70k Just Lose It Again yeah bro Michael it happens bro it happens all the time don't worry I'm I'm cool with it I'm just tired Tina can you give

discount code for platinum membership going to be reaching out to those guys in the next 10\", 'model': 'gpt-4o', 'ai_explanation': \"The transcript from Tino's live discussion revolves around the current market conditions and potential movements across various financial markets, including stocks, bonds, forex, and cryptocurrency. Here's a summary of Tino's key points and his directional bias:\\n\\n1. **Market Overview**: Tino discusses the impact of lower unemployment claims and impending manufacturing data on market conditions, emphasizing that this reflects a strong labor market and potentially influences Federal Reserve interest rate decisions.\\n\\n2. **Tech Sector & Stock Market**: Tino talks about Nvidia's market cap comparison to past trends with Cisco, noting a historical crash could imply a future one. Yet, the focus on earnings from major companies like Tesla, Google, and Amazon suggests optimism in the market, particularly in tech stocks, which he expects could lead to a market pump.\\n\\n3. **Treasury and Forex Insights**: There's a lot of talk about the activities in the treasury markets and the possibility of forex interventions, especially concerning the Japanese Yen. If an intervention occurs, it might lead to a depreciation of the dollar, influencing the bond market.\\n\\n4. **Cryptocurrency Outlook**: Tino touches on how upcoming elections might influence Bitcoin. He suggests that, despite optimism, structural changes and market conditions—like interest rate decisions and economic health—will play a more significant role than political events. He speculates that Bitcoin could hit an all-time high by the election but warns that taxes on crypto could complicate the market environment.\\n\\n5. **Trading Strategy and Sentiment**: Tino seems to suggest a cautious approach, with specific attention to economic indicators and earnings reports. His trading is based on technical setups like the Brinks Box strategy, and he is not committing fully to one market direction but is navigating through short-term market movements.\\n\\n**Directional Bias**:\\n- **Stocks (S&P and NASDAQ)**: Slightly bullish, anticipating good performance from earnings (e.g., Tesla).\\n- **Bonds and Forex**: Neutral to bearish on bonds if market prefers cash/gold, and watching for potential forex intervention.\\n- **Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)**: Tentative bullishness looking towards a potential uptrend by the election but tempered by broader economic metrics and market sentiment.\\n\\nReading between the lines, Tino's analysis reflects a recognition of complex market interdependencies and the unpredictability of exact price movements. Despite earnings optimism, he is cautious, focusing on how broader economic indicators will impact future market moves. His frustration with simplistic expectations for guaranteed predictions highlights the inherent uncertainty in trading and his commitment to reacting to real-time data rather than forecasts alone.\"}\n",

Here\\'s the gist of what he\\'s conveying:\\n\\n1. **Bitcoin Directional Bias**: Tino appears to be bullish on Bitcoin, anticipating a potential breakout of the 68K zone. However, he advises prudence by suggesting traders take some profits off the table if a breakout occurs during the New York session, indicating he expects possible ranging or consolidation after this move.\\n\\n2. **Stock Market Volatility**: He notes the notable volatility in NASDAQ and S&P due to market sentiment around bond yields. Investors are adjusting their expectations regarding future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, hence the uptick in yields. This suggests a slightly bearish sentiment as more volatility can indicate uncertainty or a potential pullback.\\n\\n3. **Gold Market Insight**: Tino implies a short-term bullish bias on gold, driven by geopolitical tensions (e.g., war overseas). However, he warns that if the Fed does not cut interest rates as expected, gold prices might retreat. This presents a scenario where traders need to be cautious and ready to adjust positions based on Federal Reserve policy announcements.\\n\\n4. **Brinks Box Strategy**: Tino underscores the importance of using the \"Brinks box\" strategy during the New York session. This involves identifying the first high and low in the market\\'s opening hour and monitoring price action relative to these levels. His focus here implies that traders should look for confirmation before committing to trades, particularly watching for vector candles that could indicate false breakouts or traps.\\n\\n5. **Market Sentiment**: The mention of a strong dollar indicates an underlying bullish sentiment towards cash, perhaps due to investors seeking safe havens amidst global uncertainty or expecting higher returns given current interest rate dynamics.\\n\\nReading between the lines, Tino suggests an overall cautious and strategic trading approach given the current market dynamics and uncertainties. His recommendations seem aimed at managing risk while being open to opportunities. The emphasis on structured trading techniques like the \"Brinks box\" further suggests he values disciplined trading strategies over impulsive decisions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Tino\\'s directional bias seems to be cautiously optimistic on Bitcoin, neutral to slightly bearish on stock indices due to volatility, and conditionally bullish on gold, with a significant reliance on real-time developments and strategies like the Brinks box to navigate the trading day.'}\n",

Bitcoin is cautiously optimistic, with potential for upward movement. Here's a breakdown of the insights and underlying sentiments conveyed in the transcript:\\n\\n1. **Bitcoin's Current Position**: Tino highlights the significance of Bitcoin's position around $70,000, indicating that maintaining above $70,500 is crucial for further upward potential. This suggests a bullish outlook, contingent on Bitcoin sustaining key levels.\\n\\n2. **Market Context and Google Earnings**: The importance of Google's earnings is emphasized, as they can significantly impact market sentiment, especially in the technology sector. Positive Google earnings may lead to favorable conditions for Bitcoin and other risk assets. However, he advises caution during the New York open when these earnings are released due to potential volatility.\\n\\n3. **AI Market Influence**: The discussion about the AI sector, driven by companies like Nvidia and Google, implies that strong tech earnings can provide a supportive environment for Bitcoin's price action. This interlinked market sentiment highlights a bullish undertone contingent on tech performance.\\n\\n4. **Potential Risks and Corrections**: Tino urges traders to be cautious of a potential sharp correction if Bitcoin were to drop below key moving averages (such as the 13 EMA on the daily), highlighting the risk of a 4.5% drop from current levels. This serves as a reminder to manage risk, even in a bullish scenario.\\n\\n5. **Market Illusions and Fed Policies**: He warns against complacency in the market and stresses the potential for a pullback if Federal Reserve policies or broader economic indicators shift. This caution indicates awareness of macroeconomic factors that could influence Bitcoin's price trajectory.\\n\\n6. **Institutional Interest and Accumulation**: Notably, Tino mentions significant Bitcoin inflows and accumulation by major players like BlackRock, suggesting strong institutional interest, which is a positive signal for Bitcoin's long-term prospects.\\n\\n7. **Trading Strategy and Psychological Factors**: Tino emphasizes managing expectations and taking profits, especially as Bitcoin approaches all-time highs. He discusses potential psychological barriers for traders and investors at these levels, suggesting a prudent approach of taking profits to mitigate risks of sharp pullbacks.\\n\\n8. **Volatility and Upcoming Events**: Upcoming events, such as the U.S. elections, monthly candle closures, and further earnings reports, are highlighted as factors that could introduce volatility, reinforcing the need for vigilance.\\n\\nIn essence, Tino conveys a cautiously bullish stance for Bitcoin, with optimism tied to supportive tech earnings and institutional accumulation. However, he stresses the importance of risk management and staying alert to market shifts that could trigger corrections. For traders, this means considering both the potential for gains and the necessity of protecting against sudden market reversals.\"}\n"
